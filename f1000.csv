"Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to clinical enteral nutrition knowledge at public hospitals in Sana'a, Yemen: A basis for remodeling safety and quality of care standards",0.0,"First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of healthcare that warrants a quality overhaul. I am saddened by the findings although it is critical to make everyone know through research dissemination so readers can ruminate on culturally-relevant training and support for nurses, joint policy-making between implementers and surveillance agencies, and exercise of governance for reviewing the standards for patient safety.  Second, the descriptive statistics have underscored the reality that met the aims of the study. However, the data distribution could have been indicated and explored for skewness in order to expose the gaps in knowledge distribution. This knowledge distribution may reveal implicit 'disparity' (the access of resources and culturally inflated communicative actions). There is discourse of representation by the data points.  Third, the Chi-square tests and Fisher exact test did work, but if the authors can consider finding causal relationships then it would be a lot meaningful at the level of designing an intervention that targets specific factors/variables.  Fourth, establishing that Yemeni nurses have inadequate knowledge should not only be exploratory rather explanatory. Plans for training improvement must be articulated explicitly. It is clear that the authors just wanted to tell the world about a pervasive problem in Yemen, but the problem is at the healthcare system level. So, it may not only be a case of enteral nutrition.  Fifth, I have these suggestions:  The title will be better if revised to: ""Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to clinical enteral nutrition knowledge in Sana'a, Yemen public hospitals: A basis for remodeling safety and quality of care standards"".   The discussion must connect the level of knowledge with (threat to) patient safety and quality improvements required.

Approved The manuscript ""Intensive care nurses' knowledge of enteral nutrition at public hospitals in Sana'a, Yemen: a cross-sectional survey"" by Talal Ali Hussein Al-Qalah, et al. is a descriptive cross-sectional study from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. The authors intended to assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the management of enteral nutrition. The authors recruit 174 nurses in 2019. The authors found that 46% of them had an inadequate level of knowledge regarding enteral nutrition management. From my impressions, the aim of this study may not be interested in countries other than Yemen.  Introduction: Please clearly state “what is unknown” in their topic. It is unclear why the authors did this study.   Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the authors used. Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?   Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire which was previously developed or which was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was newly created, how and why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was considered inadequate, 51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate. The cut-off score should be carefully selected.   Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic regression. How to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-square test?   Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test is more suitable than chi-square test.   Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the previous study, how and why the authors could compare the results?   Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management improve clinical outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and training courses were not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion should be based on their results.   Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this paper all over the world?  Abstract:  The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results such as the areas with high level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge. Remove the excessive description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.   Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be better if you summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.    Methods:   Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the hospitals. Maintaining the confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.   Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write : according to a previous study(..) ….   Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.   Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN formula, …….. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be better.   Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘ reliability’ and replace it by ‘ internal consistency’.   Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So , delete ‘ multinomial logistic regression’.    Results:  In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in describing the results need a revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.   Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and compares between the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the table presents the knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and compare between them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.    Discussion:  Discussion must be on the main important findings based on the objectives of the study. No need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the discussion about the participants' characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels, and work experience. Describing those characteristic in results part is enough.    General   The paper needs English language editing.   ","First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of healthcare that warrants a quality overhaul.

Thermal performance of gasifier cooking stoves: A systematic literature review,-0.5,"The review focuses on gasifier stoves and their thermal performances. I applaud the hard work of the authors, however there are significant improvements required.   Although the literature may be limited due to the technology being limited to use in certain parts of the world,  a wide range of technical resources can be found based on gasification process and biomass power generation. the review fails to merge the scientific relations between such processes and hence does not provide any technical information behind statistical data? For example, the article states wood pellet shows better efficiency but fails to analyze the reason behind it.  Although a review article, it should necessarily go over adequate amount of technology description. For example the article provides no background on how thermal performances are measured, what experiments are usually performed, examples of such set ups. For a small review of 28 literatures, it was possible to have in depth discussion of some of the technical aspects and design aspects.  In addition, the review focuses a lot on how the articles were searched and geological location of research and how often research was published. However, I do not think these are relevant and provide any scientific merit to the work.  I have several recommendations for the authors, if followed will greatly improve the quality of the article. My recommendations are listed below-  Abstract should not contain how articles were searched. this is irrelevant for technical paper review. It should focus on how many types of stoves you reviewed, how many fuels (feeds) reviewed, some of the technical challenges, methods used to calculate efficiency and a few line summary of why some setups and fuels perform better than others.   In introduction it would be better to talk about biomass fuel types. There is a broader category of fuel types based on source -  Agricultural, Forest, Animal Residue, Solids and Plastic Waste, MSW. And then by constituent of organic matter - Lignin, lignocellulosic, cellulosic, hemi cellulosic etc. Author may want to define the types based such technical norms and then set up the review based on such fuel types. Otherwise the comparisons will not have any common variable. for example woodchip always performs better while agricultural waste will always perform worse due to organic constituent. Thus comparing two different types over several types of stoves will not provide much technical understanding   Instead of Dung authors may want to write Animal Waste. It covers a broader area.    The Methods section is completely irrelevant to the technical purpose of the article. If it is not required by the Journal Guideline, it is best to remove this section.    Review papers do not contain Results and Discussion. Since authors are describing what is already published in brief.   Instead of Methods and Results and discussion sections, authors may want to have sections as Stove Types -  overviewing different stoves and their design and challenges. Types of Experiments Conducted to measure efficiency. Efficiency by fuel type and how it changes, reasoning behind and how stove design influences it.   Similar to the reasons stated above, Figure 1-4, 6 and Table 1 and 2 does not have any meaningful technical contribution and thus should be removed if not required by Journal guideline.    In addition, the data for figure 2-6 are questionable. Since the author filters a lot of literatures, such numbers do not reflect actual scenario. Thus it is best to avoid it.    There is a tremendous scope to add technical reasoning for this review. For example, each type of cooking stove efficiency should be backed up by how it was measured and what setup was used and how to calculate it.   Similar reasoning should also be used to describe efficiency issues for fuels   Why was swirl vane producer gas burner was not included in gasified stoves comparison in figure 7. Essentially Gasification or Gasified process results in producer gas?   Why does the premixed producer gas with swirl vane have a very high efficiency compared to other technologies? Please describe   Similarly why does wood pellets perform better than corn straw? Please describe   Similar descriptions should be provided for all cases  presented in Table 3, 4 and 5  I wish the authors best of luck with their future work. This work presents a statistical review of the thermal performance of gasifier cooking stoves. While the content of this article is important to understand the aspects of designing and energy performance evaluation of gas stoves for the countries where this type of stoves are still in use, it does not have a clear conclusion or future recommendations regarding how to improve the performance in terms of energy efficiency and environmental pollution. There should be more concise action words to address this issue. Below are some of my concerns:  I am against putting Table-2 altogether. Everyone knows how to search, and it should not be on the table. The references are included, which should suffice the explanation of the search method.   What are the authors' conclusions about the different types of cooking stoves? Which design is better and why? More explanations are necessary. Also, I advise including their design and working principles.   The authors mention, ""this finding will help researchers, organizations and government to investigate and implement this type of cooking stoves based on the geographical location so that the adoption rate of the research can increase."" If these stoves are already in use in those locations, it is unclear why the government should implement them. They are already in use.   The authors talk about different materials. While it is clear why steel stoves are widely used for fabricating gas stoves, I am not clear why other materials are there. Do those materials improve the design and efficiency? More explanation is necessary.   For each fuel, there should be sufficient research on the health impact and environmental pollution. The authors should conduct a review in these areas and add it to this work, and it should not be left for future recommendations.  ","The review focuses on gasifier stoves and their thermal performances.

Staining ability of herbal tea preparations on a nano-filled composite restorative material – an in-vitro study,0.0,"I have given my suggestions in the attached PDF. This manuscript needs major revision before acceptance for indexing. I think this paper is excellent and well written. I really like the conceptualisation of analysing the staining ability of herbal tea preparation that have become a popular beverage in India as well as internationally. It is an important addition to literature. It has been observed that the spectrophotometric analysis has been described in details. Statistical analysis has been done meticulously which is really appreciable. The use of recent citations has increased the credibility of the article. However, I have a few queries that require clearance. They have been mentioned as follows:  How was the sample size calculated?   Why was the 15 mins time of immersion selected as it doesn't simulate the natural intake of beverage? This can lead to a difference in case of an in vivo scenario.   Why 4 mm thickness of the samples have been selected? The general increment while curing with LED light is 2 mm unless the composite is a bulk fill. ",I have given my suggestions in the attached PDF.

A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia,-1.0,"Title: A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia  Overall comments:  This study was brief and does not address the study's objective, i.e., the validity of FSFI-6-Bahasa Indonesia. The study mainly focuses on the reliability of the FSFI-6 Bahasa Indonesia. The study should cover many validation areas, i.e., face, content, concurrent and factorial validity. Nothing was mentioned about this process, i.e., the face value of the questionnaire in Bahasa Indonesia after the translation (validated across the group of women – such as in the group of the high-income and low-income – rural and urban settings – professional (nurses) and non-professional (janitors) and etc., content expert validation of a panel of specialists (their specialty and years of clinical training in the panel group), the cut-off point for the rating scale (concurrent validity) to determine the positive cases [sexual dysfunction] vs. non-cases [no sexual dysfunction], and factorial validity to examine and determine that the factor-structure of the scale is actually similar from the West with the concept of sexual functioning (sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction) among the Indonesian population.   Regarding abstract:  As per the above comments, the abstract is absent with the validation of the FSFI-6 Bahasa Indonesia.  Regarding the introduction:   The statement, “FSFI-19 may be too long for clinical studies, especially in Indonesian women, who do not talk openly about their sexual problems and get embarrassed quickly when talking about sexuality” is very confusing. Is FSFI too long to take for an assessment? Is the content (i.e., face validity) of FSFI intimate and explicit (which other studies, for example, FSFI-19-Malay, were found to be acceptable culturally in Malaysian norm)?  Regarding methods and results:  It is unclear how the respondents were recruited and what validation was performed.  The discussion was not addressing the objective of the study. Although the study used a 50+ sample size, it failed to follow established guidelines for cross-cultural validation/adaptation. For instance:  Permission needs to first be obtained from the original English developers of the FSFI-6 before translation to another language, although we can overlook this.   The forward and backward translations should be done by expert bilingual translators, not by clinicians.   The questionnaire was not piloted after translation which is very important to hear feedback from others and then perform peer debriefing.   There was no mention of measuring content and face validity.   You should also have measured at least the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire, not just computing Chronbach's alpha.   Was the normality of the data checked before conducting Pearson’s product‑moment correlation analysis?   You have not performed responsiveness analysis but have yet to fail to include it in your limitations.  Addressing the above issues would add value to your study. I am afraid to tell you that your study is flawed but if you can those issues, I will be happy to review it again.","Title: A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia  Overall comments:  This study was brief and does not address the study's objective, i.e., the validity of FSFI-6-Bahasa Indonesia.

"The first released available genome of the common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.) extended the research region on salt tolerance, C3-CAM photosynthetic conversion, and halophism",0.0,"This study is of significant importance, and the authors have utilized the best genome assembly platform for shotgun sequencing. However, there are a few minor concerns that need to be addressed:  In the sample materials, it is mentioned that the ice plants were treated with 0.3% (w/w) NaCl for 5 weeks. Please double-check the unit, should it be w/v (weight/volume) instead of w/w (weight/weight)? Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors could provide information about the nutrient content in OAT1 House No.1 and No.2. Most importantly, the authors should clarify the CAM status of the ice plant before sampling.   Although the author compared the ice plant genome against several other plant species, no CAM plants or C4 plants were included. It is recommended that the authors consider adding pineapple to the comparison.   The authors mentioned the release date of the SILVA database as 2020.08. It would be preferable if the authors could change the version of the database to its standard name, SILVA 138.1.

A socio-legal imperative of domestic violence prohibition in Africa vis-a-vis Nigerian legal structure for sexually abused women,0.5,"The article examines domestic violence prevalence in Nigeria and examines some other jurisdictions.   There is a need for diligent proofreading of the article. The last three sentences of paragraph 3 and the first 3 sentences of paragraph 4 are the same. There are other repetitions in the work that distort the flow of the work.  Some parts of the article refer to statistical data and other scholarly work but there were no corresponding references. This needs to be addressed. For instance, the data on the percentage of men and women that experience domestic violence was not referenced.  The claim that daughters and grand-daughters are taught to normalize domestic violence and GBV should be revised to reflect the position of male children. Does preferential treatment also suggest that male children are taught to believe and exert domination over females? Is that also a way of normalizing domestic violence for male children which contributes to the unbroken chain?  Reference to domestic violence in Ghana suggests that things have changed but there is no indication throughout the paper on what has changed and if any progress has been made in Ghana. This leaves a gap in the mind of the reader on what that aspect tends to communicate.   The claim that there is no data on domestic violence in India should be revisited. There is a difference between lack of data and inadequate or inaccurate data.   Reliance on data from a 1995-1998 survey to take a position on domestic violence in America is outdated. Does that suggest that nothing has been done since 1998 that will change the statistics? Also, the discussion of domestic violence in America under a sub-heading that suggests that the section is focused on Europe is misleading.   On page 7, the position that domestic violence is a ground for divorce in Nigeria should be changed to reflect that domestic violence can be claimed to prove that a marriage has broken down irretrievable. The only ground for divorce of statutory marriage is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Also, the reference on this note (42) should be corrected to section 15(2)(e) and not 15(1)(e) of the MCA.  The claim of the one-sided right to divorce in Islamic marriage should be reviewed. The authors may argue on the imbalance or inequality in divorce rights and not one-sided rights. It is important to compare the concept of talaq and khul to effectively make this argument.   The author's position on marital rape needs to be updated. Though, under sections 6 & 357 of the Criminal Code Act and section 382(2) of the Penal Code Act, marital rape is not recognized as a crime. However, the authors should evaluate this argument in line with VAPPA, ACJA, and the Constitution. Section 42(2) of the VAPPA is important in resolving conflict of laws in this regard. Though the authors made reference to this towards the end of the paper, this is a very important argument and should flow appropriately.   On the gender perspective of domestic violence in Nigeria, the authors needs to review the general application of the VAPPA to all persons irrespective of the nature of the marriage entered into.   The claim that the authorities often ignored cases of IPV in Nigeria is misleading. Several reports from the appropriate government agencies, NGOs, and INGOs show otherwise. Institutional restructuring across Nigeria also shows otherwise. For instance, in recent times, many police stations now have a gender desk with officers constantly trained to empower them in responding to domestic violence and GBV cases. Advocacy work is also evident in this area. The effectiveness and progress made may be worth evaluating.   The authors claim that only four states in Nigeria have enacted laws on domestic violence whereas the corresponding reference shows about 8 states. Presently, almost 20 states have taken legislative and policy steps directly and indirectly on domestic violence in Nigeria. There is a need to refer to current literature on this aspect in order to provide an up to date information.   The conclusion of a scholarly work should basically give a summary of what has been done and not introduce something new that was not discussed in the paper. The authors should reflect on this and avoid introducing new elements in the conclusion. Also, avoid making reference to other works in the conclusion and recommendations since these parts are expected to be solely your work.   Finally, the authors' voices were missing from the paper. There is a need to clearly take a position that reflects the stand of the authors. The article presents a panoramic perspective of the socio-legal imperative of domestic violence prohibition in the African Continent with particular reference to Nigeria. It makes a comparative analysis of the occurrences of the menace of domestic violence in different socio-cultural settings particularly in India and Nigeria which have similar socio-political characteristics.  The article is clear, easy to understand and unequivocally addresses the social and legal issues it aims to achieve. It is my calculated opinion that the article is publishable and definitely contributes to knowledge especially as domestic violence in Nigeria is concerned.  It is, however, suggested that the recommendations articulated by the authors should be written in paragraphs or enumerated instead of the dotted symbols used. The revisions made are in order, kindly index the article. Thank you. Abstract  Secondary data and not tertiary is preferably used.  The result or findings section of the abstract should incorporate more findings made by the study.  Introduction  The introduction of the paper was quite elaborate and well-articulated. However there is need for a proper gap identification that will help the readers understand the focal point of study.  Objective of this study  There is need for clarity on the objective of the study as that will help to guide the focus of the study.  An analysis of domestic violence incidents in Africa and other selected countries  Under this subheading, the authors projected legal framework around domestic violence as it were in the traditional societies and failed to project the current move by different countries to ameliorate the menace of domestic violence.  Domestic violence is no longer a hush-hush issue as it were in the past. The culture of silence over domestic violence has been broken, many people are beginning to speak out. Similarly the paper should also look into the roles of some of the treaties many of the aforementioned African counties are signatory to that has also helped to reduce domestic violence.  Similarly some states in Nigeria have also adopted more stringent sanctions and panel codes for some types of gender based violence, the functionality and effectiveness of some of the laws should also be interrogated.  Asian continent with a focus on India as the selected country  Under this subheading and in the previous one, the authors should justify the reasons for selection of India among all the Asian countries. Similarly, the criteria used for the selection of some of the countries under discuss should also be made clear.  The lack of clarity in the justification and criteria could also be because the authors did not dedicate a subheading to address the methodology used in the study, it was only mentioned in the abstract.

"Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, and Mental Health Literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS): A preliminary evaluation of suicide prevention",0.0,"This is a valuable piece of work considering the high prevalence of suicidal behaviour in this population, however there are a few issues that I suggest to address:  Please support this statement 'the participants had little knowledge about psychiatry and suicide because they were second-year undergraduates'.   I have great concerns about labelling an intervention as 'suicide prevention' when the training materials are about mental health literacy as it is based on the (north-European/American) biomedical model of suicide that sees suicide fundamentally as caused by mental illness. This belief is contested by cultural/global mental health and critical suicidology scholars and the authors must justify their decision to develop a training based on the English speaking countries MHFA, when they also had the option, for instance, to use the tool that was specifically developed for Japan but is not even mentioned in the article, i.e. Colucci et al., 20111.   Similarly measuring depression as distal measurement for suicide is based on the same assumption indicated above and the authors should show first of all awareness of this belief and second justify it (and paper contains many of these assumptions as demonstrated by this statement 'Surprisingly, this reduction in suicidal ideation was not accompanied by marked changes in depression severity scores').   The limitations section should include the limitations stated above, namely that the authors used MH literacy instead of suicide literacy specifically.  This paper presents data from a gatekeeper program in Japan with undergraduate medical students. There are many strengths of the paper, including that it is well-written, with clear methodology and presentation of results. It also includes several key outcome variables, including suicide risk, depression, and changes in stigma, attitudes, and awareness, encompassing many of the critical outcomes in this type of work. Other prior studies have not examined all of these interesting outcomes. However, there are a few minor issues that could strengthen the paper.  First, for an international audience, it may be helpful to describe the “undergraduate medical student” sample, as medical school is a professional school that comes after an undergraduate education in many Western countries.  Second, there are some minor concerns about the interpretation of the results that should be addressed. Specifically, the changes in the suicide measure are presented in a way that is either confusing or may distort the magnitude of the change. I would suggest reporting a dichotomous cutoff of high risk v low risk, in which the authors put people into two categories pre-intervention and follow-up, and then do a chi-square test so there can be an actual inferential statistic there. Also, the description of the depression scores improving though non-statistically significantly should be changed to “no significant improvement” – the change was very small and the effect size was 0, so it is misleading to say there was any change.  Otherwise, I think this is a nice paper that makes a contribution to the literature.","This is a valuable piece of work considering the high prevalence of suicidal behaviour in this population, however there are a few issues that I suggest to address:  Please support this statement 'the participants had little knowledge about psychiatry and suicide because they were second-year undergraduates'.   I have great concerns about labelling an intervention as 'suicide prevention' when the training materials are about mental health literacy as it is based on the (north-European/American) biomedical model of suicide that sees suicide fundamentally as caused by mental illness.

"Associated ICU nurses' characteristics to clinical enteral nutrition knowledge at public hospitals in Sana'a, Yemen: A basis for remodeling safety and quality of care standards",0.0,"First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of healthcare that warrants a quality overhaul.

Second, the descriptive statistics have underscored the reality that met the aims of the study.

Fourth, establishing that Yemeni nurses have inadequate knowledge should not only be exploratory rather explanatory. Plans for training improvement must be articulated explicitly. It is clear that the authors just wanted to tell the world about a pervasive problem in Yemen, but the problem is at the healthcare system level. So, it may not only be a case of enteral nutrition.

Approved The manuscript ""Intensive care nurses' knowledge of enteral nutrition at public hospitals in Sana'a, Yemen: a cross-sectional survey"" by Talal Ali Hussein Al-Qalah, et al. is a descriptive cross-sectional study from four public hospitals in the capital city of Yemen. The authors intended to assess the level of ICU nurses’ knowledge regarding the management of enteral nutrition. The authors recruit 174 nurses in 2019. The authors found that 46% of them had an inadequate level of knowledge regarding enteral nutrition management. From my impressions, the aim of this study may not be interested in countries other than Yemen.  Introduction: Please clearly state “what is unknown” in their topic. It is unclear why the authors did this study.   Methods: Sample size determination: I’m not familiar with the equation the authors used. Can the authors provide the reference to support this sample size calculation?   Methods: Did the authors use the questionnaire which was previously developed or which was newly created? If the authors use the questionnaire which was newly created, how and why the authors could define that a score of 50% or less was considered inadequate, 51–75% moderate, while 76% and above was considered adequate. The cut-off score should be carefully selected.   Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic regression. How to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-square test?   Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test is more suitable than chi-square test.   Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the previous study, how and why the authors could compare the results?   Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management improve clinical outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and training courses were not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion should be based on their results.   Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this paper all over the world?  Abstract:  The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results such as the areas with high level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge. Remove the excessive description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.   Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be better if you summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.    Methods:   Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the hospitals. Maintaining the confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.   Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write : according to a previous study(..) ….   Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.   Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN formula, …….. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be better.   Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘ reliability’ and replace it by ‘ internal consistency’.   Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So , delete ‘ multinomial logistic regression’.    Results:  In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in describing the results need a revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.   Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and compares between the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the table presents the knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and compare between them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.    Discussion:  Discussion must be on the main important findings based on the objectives of the study. No need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the discussion about the participants' characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels, and work experience. Describing those characteristic in results part is enough.    General   The paper needs English language editing.   ","First of all, reading the manuscript gives vital information of the quality of healthcare that warrants a quality overhaul.

The cut-off score should be carefully selected.   Methods: Please clearly describe how to perform the multinomial logistic regression. How to obtain the p-values in Table 2? Multinomial logistic regression? Chi-square test?   Methods: Because the cells in Table 2 contained under <5, Fisher exact test is more suitable than chi-square test.   Discussion: If the authors used the different questionnaire used in the previous study, how and why the authors could compare the results?   Conclusions: Is there any evidence that training courses in EN management improve clinical outcomes? Based on the results of your study, the only thing the authors revealed was that low SES was associated with inadequate knowledge. Experience and training courses were not associated with improved knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion should be based on their results.   Discussion: What is new in this study? What can the readers act from this paper all over the world? ","Abstract:  The results part in the abstract should focus on the main results such as the areas with high level of knowledge and areas with lower level of knowledge. Remove the excessive description of the sample socio-demographic characteristic.   Conclusion part has been written as a recommendation only. It will be better if you summarize the findings then make a brief recommendation.    Methods:   Under the setting subtitle no need to mention the names of the hospitals. Maintaining the confidentiality of participant hospitals. No need to mention the duration of the study under the setting subtitle, it is mentioned under data collection.   Delete this ‘According to Al-Hawaly, Ibrahim, and Qalawa’ and write : according to a previous study(..) ….   Instead of citing the tool they have developed and used, authors must mention and cite the references and literature that had been used in developing the tool.   Per authors, the second part of data collection instrument contains three subsections which are the before EN administration, during EN administration, and after EN administration. Accepting that this categorization is correct, it is not clear which items are under each subsection. Moreover, most of the 17 items are not related to the before, during, and after EN management, they are related to general knowledge about the EN (such as the indications, goals, benefits, complications, routs, methods, types and contents of EN formula, …….. etc.), even there is an item asking about the types of nutritional support in general (enteral, parenteral, combination, ..etc.). More suitable grouping and categorizing must be used to organize the instrument or to leave it without any categorization it will be better.   Validity and reliability: delete the word ‘ reliability’ and replace it by ‘ internal consistency’.   Under the data analysis subtitle, they mentioned that a multinomial logistic regression test was conducted. In fact, no multinomial logistic regression test was done. So , delete ‘ multinomial logistic regression’.    Results:  In results, the use of some terms (such as most, majority) in describing the results need a revision. For example: 49.40% is not a majority.   Table 2 presents the frequency and percentage of the participants and compares between the subgroups using the Chi-square tests. I think it will be better if the table presents the knowledge means scores and standard deviations of the subgroups and compare between them by the t or f tests. After that multiple regression can be performed.    Discussion:  Discussion must be on the main important findings based on the objectives of the study. No need to write two paragraphs at the beginning of the discussion about the participants' characteristics such as age, gender, educational levels, and work experience. Describing those characteristic in results part is enough.    General   The paper needs English language editing.   ",
Thermal performance of gasifier cooking stoves: A systematic literature review,-0.5,"The review focuses on gasifier stoves and their thermal performances. I applaud the hard work of the authors, however there are significant improvements required.   Although the literature may be limited due to the technology being limited to use in certain parts of the world,  a wide range of technical resources can be found based on gasification process and biomass power generation. the review fails to merge the scientific relations between such processes and hence does not provide any technical information behind statistical data? For example, the article states wood pellet shows better efficiency but fails to analyze the reason behind it.  Although a review article, it should necessarily go over adequate amount of technology description. For example the article provides no background on how thermal performances are measured, what experiments are usually performed, examples of such set ups. For a small review of 28 literatures, it was possible to have in depth discussion of some of the technical aspects and design aspects.  In addition, the review focuses a lot on how the articles were searched and geological location of research and how often research was published. However, I do not think these are relevant and provide any scientific merit to the work.  I have several recommendations for the authors, if followed will greatly improve the quality of the article. My recommendations are listed below-  Abstract should not contain how articles were searched. this is irrelevant for technical paper review. It should focus on how many types of stoves you reviewed, how many fuels (feeds) reviewed, some of the technical challenges, methods used to calculate efficiency and a few line summary of why some setups and fuels perform better than others.   In introduction it would be better to talk about biomass fuel types. There is a broader category of fuel types based on source -  Agricultural, Forest, Animal Residue, Solids and Plastic Waste, MSW. And then by constituent of organic matter - Lignin, lignocellulosic, cellulosic, hemi cellulosic etc. Author may want to define the types based such technical norms and then set up the review based on such fuel types. Otherwise the comparisons will not have any common variable. for example woodchip always performs better while agricultural waste will always perform worse due to organic constituent. Thus comparing two different types over several types of stoves will not provide much technical understanding   Instead of Dung authors may want to write Animal Waste. It covers a broader area.    The Methods section is completely irrelevant to the technical purpose of the article. If it is not required by the Journal Guideline, it is best to remove this section.    Review papers do not contain Results and Discussion. Since authors are describing what is already published in brief.   Instead of Methods and Results and discussion sections, authors may want to have sections as Stove Types -  overviewing different stoves and their design and challenges. Types of Experiments Conducted to measure efficiency. Efficiency by fuel type and how it changes, reasoning behind and how stove design influences it.   Similar to the reasons stated above, Figure 1-4, 6 and Table 1 and 2 does not have any meaningful technical contribution and thus should be removed if not required by Journal guideline.    In addition, the data for figure 2-6 are questionable. Since the author filters a lot of literatures, such numbers do not reflect actual scenario. Thus it is best to avoid it.    There is a tremendous scope to add technical reasoning for this review. For example, each type of cooking stove efficiency should be backed up by how it was measured and what setup was used and how to calculate it.   Similar reasoning should also be used to describe efficiency issues for fuels   Why was swirl vane producer gas burner was not included in gasified stoves comparison in figure 7. Essentially Gasification or Gasified process results in producer gas?   Why does the premixed producer gas with swirl vane have a very high efficiency compared to other technologies? Please describe   Similarly why does wood pellets perform better than corn straw? Please describe   Similar descriptions should be provided for all cases  presented in Table 3, 4 and 5  I wish the authors best of luck with their future work. This work presents a statistical review of the thermal performance of gasifier cooking stoves. While the content of this article is important to understand the aspects of designing and energy performance evaluation of gas stoves for the countries where this type of stoves are still in use, it does not have a clear conclusion or future recommendations regarding how to improve the performance in terms of energy efficiency and environmental pollution. There should be more concise action words to address this issue. Below are some of my concerns:  I am against putting Table-2 altogether. Everyone knows how to search, and it should not be on the table. The references are included, which should suffice the explanation of the search method.   What are the authors' conclusions about the different types of cooking stoves? Which design is better and why? More explanations are necessary. Also, I advise including their design and working principles.   The authors mention, ""this finding will help researchers, organizations and government to investigate and implement this type of cooking stoves based on the geographical location so that the adoption rate of the research can increase."" If these stoves are already in use in those locations, it is unclear why the government should implement them. They are already in use.   The authors talk about different materials. While it is clear why steel stoves are widely used for fabricating gas stoves, I am not clear why other materials are there. Do those materials improve the design and efficiency? More explanation is necessary.   For each fuel, there should be sufficient research on the health impact and environmental pollution. The authors should conduct a review in these areas and add it to this work, and it should not be left for future recommendations.  ","The review focuses on gasifier stoves and their thermal performances.

Staining ability of herbal tea preparations on a nano-filled composite restorative material – an in-vitro study,0.0,"I have given my suggestions in the attached PDF. This manuscript needs major revision before acceptance for indexing. I think this paper is excellent and well written.

Statistical analysis has been done meticulously which is really appreciable. The use of recent citations has increased the credibility of the article. However, I have a few queries that require clearance. They have been mentioned as follows:  How was the sample size calculated?   Why was the 15 mins time of immersion selected as it doesn't simulate the natural intake of beverage? This can lead to a difference in case of an in vivo scenario.   Why 4 mm thickness of the samples have been selected? The general increment while curing with LED light is 2 mm unless the composite is a bulk fill. ",I have given my suggestions in the attached PDF.

A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia,-1.0,"Title: A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia  Overall comments:  This study was brief and does not address the study's objective, i.e., the validity of FSFI-6-Bahasa Indonesia. The study mainly focuses on the reliability of the FSFI-6 Bahasa Indonesia. The study should cover many validation areas, i.e., face, content, concurrent and factorial validity. Nothing was mentioned about this process, i.e., the face value of the questionnaire in Bahasa Indonesia after the translation (validated across the group of women – such as in the group of the high-income and low-income – rural and urban settings – professional (nurses) and non-professional (janitors) and etc., content expert validation of a panel of specialists (their specialty and years of clinical training in the panel group), the cut-off point for the rating scale (concurrent validity) to determine the positive cases [sexual dysfunction] vs. non-cases [no sexual dysfunction], and factorial validity to examine and determine that the factor-structure of the scale is actually similar from the West with the concept of sexual functioning (sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction) among the Indonesian population.   Regarding abstract:  As per the above comments, the abstract is absent with the validation of the FSFI-6 Bahasa Indonesia.  Regarding the introduction:   The statement, “FSFI-19 may be too long for clinical studies, especially in Indonesian women, who do not talk openly about their sexual problems and get embarrassed quickly when talking about sexuality” is very confusing. Is FSFI too long to take for an assessment? Is the content (i.e., face validity) of FSFI intimate and explicit (which other studies, for example, FSFI-19-Malay, were found to be acceptable culturally in Malaysian norm)?  Regarding methods and results:  It is unclear how the respondents were recruited and what validation was performed.  The discussion was not addressing the objective of the study. Although the study used a 50+ sample size, it failed to follow established guidelines for cross-cultural validation/adaptation. For instance:  Permission needs to first be obtained from the original English developers of the FSFI-6 before translation to another language, although we can overlook this.   The forward and backward translations should be done by expert bilingual translators, not by clinicians.   The questionnaire was not piloted after translation which is very important to hear feedback from others and then perform peer debriefing.   There was no mention of measuring content and face validity.   You should also have measured at least the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire, not just computing Chronbach's alpha.   Was the normality of the data checked before conducting Pearson’s product‑moment correlation analysis?   You have not performed responsiveness analysis but have yet to fail to include it in your limitations.  Addressing the above issues would add value to your study. I am afraid to tell you that your study is flawed but if you can those issues, I will be happy to review it again.","Title: A cross-sectional analysis in order to validate the translation of FSFI-6 to Bahasa Indonesia  Overall comments:  This study was brief and does not address the study's objective, i.e., the validity of FSFI-6-Bahasa Indonesia.

A socio-legal imperative of domestic violence prohibition in Africa vis-a-vis Nigerian legal structure for sexually abused women,0.5,"The article examines domestic violence prevalence in Nigeria and examines some other jurisdictions.   There is a need for diligent proofreading of the article. The last three sentences of paragraph 3 and the first 3 sentences of paragraph 4 are the same. There are other repetitions in the work that distort the flow of the work.  Some parts of the article refer to statistical data and other scholarly work but there were no corresponding references. This needs to be addressed. For instance, the data on the percentage of men and women that experience domestic violence was not referenced.  The claim that daughters and grand-daughters are taught to normalize domestic violence and GBV should be revised to reflect the position of male children. Does preferential treatment also suggest that male children are taught to believe and exert domination over females? Is that also a way of normalizing domestic violence for male children which contributes to the unbroken chain?  Reference to domestic violence in Ghana suggests that things have changed but there is no indication throughout the paper on what has changed and if any progress has been made in Ghana. This leaves a gap in the mind of the reader on what that aspect tends to communicate.   The claim that there is no data on domestic violence in India should be revisited. There is a difference between lack of data and inadequate or inaccurate data.   Reliance on data from a 1995-1998 survey to take a position on domestic violence in America is outdated. Does that suggest that nothing has been done since 1998 that will change the statistics? Also, the discussion of domestic violence in America under a sub-heading that suggests that the section is focused on Europe is misleading.   On page 7, the position that domestic violence is a ground for divorce in Nigeria should be changed to reflect that domestic violence can be claimed to prove that a marriage has broken down irretrievable. The only ground for divorce of statutory marriage is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Also, the reference on this note (42) should be corrected to section 15(2)(e) and not 15(1)(e) of the MCA.  The claim of the one-sided right to divorce in Islamic marriage should be reviewed. The authors may argue on the imbalance or inequality in divorce rights and not one-sided rights. It is important to compare the concept of talaq and khul to effectively make this argument.   The author's position on marital rape needs to be updated. Though, under sections 6 & 357 of the Criminal Code Act and section 382(2) of the Penal Code Act, marital rape is not recognized as a crime. However, the authors should evaluate this argument in line with VAPPA, ACJA, and the Constitution. Section 42(2) of the VAPPA is important in resolving conflict of laws in this regard. Though the authors made reference to this towards the end of the paper, this is a very important argument and should flow appropriately.   On the gender perspective of domestic violence in Nigeria, the authors needs to review the general application of the VAPPA to all persons irrespective of the nature of the marriage entered into.   The claim that the authorities often ignored cases of IPV in Nigeria is misleading. Several reports from the appropriate government agencies, NGOs, and INGOs show otherwise. Institutional restructuring across Nigeria also shows otherwise. For instance, in recent times, many police stations now have a gender desk with officers constantly trained to empower them in responding to domestic violence and GBV cases. Advocacy work is also evident in this area. The effectiveness and progress made may be worth evaluating.   The authors claim that only four states in Nigeria have enacted laws on domestic violence whereas the corresponding reference shows about 8 states. Presently, almost 20 states have taken legislative and policy steps directly and indirectly on domestic violence in Nigeria. There is a need to refer to current literature on this aspect in order to provide an up to date information.   The conclusion of a scholarly work should basically give a summary of what has been done and not introduce something new that was not discussed in the paper. The authors should reflect on this and avoid introducing new elements in the conclusion. Also, avoid making reference to other works in the conclusion and recommendations since these parts are expected to be solely your work.   Finally, the authors' voices were missing from the paper. There is a need to clearly take a position that reflects the stand of the authors. The article presents a panoramic perspective of the socio-legal imperative of domestic violence prohibition in the African Continent with particular reference to Nigeria. It makes a comparative analysis of the occurrences of the menace of domestic violence in different socio-cultural settings particularly in India and Nigeria which have similar socio-political characteristics.  The article is clear, easy to understand and unequivocally addresses the social and legal issues it aims to achieve. It is my calculated opinion that the article is publishable and definitely contributes to knowledge especially as domestic violence in Nigeria is concerned.  It is, however, suggested that the recommendations articulated by the authors should be written in paragraphs or enumerated instead of the dotted symbols used. The revisions made are in order, kindly index the article. Thank you. Abstract  Secondary data and not tertiary is preferably used.  The result or findings section of the abstract should incorporate more findings made by the study.  Introduction  The introduction of the paper was quite elaborate and well-articulated. However there is need for a proper gap identification that will help the readers understand the focal point of study.  Objective of this study  There is need for clarity on the objective of the study as that will help to guide the focus of the study.  An analysis of domestic violence incidents in Africa and other selected countries  Under this subheading, the authors projected legal framework around domestic violence as it were in the traditional societies and failed to project the current move by different countries to ameliorate the menace of domestic violence.  Domestic violence is no longer a hush-hush issue as it were in the past. The culture of silence over domestic violence has been broken, many people are beginning to speak out. Similarly the paper should also look into the roles of some of the treaties many of the aforementioned African counties are signatory to that has also helped to reduce domestic violence.  Similarly some states in Nigeria have also adopted more stringent sanctions and panel codes for some types of gender based violence, the functionality and effectiveness of some of the laws should also be interrogated.  Asian continent with a focus on India as the selected country  Under this subheading and in the previous one, the authors should justify the reasons for selection of India among all the Asian countries. Similarly, the criteria used for the selection of some of the countries under discuss should also be made clear.  The lack of clarity in the justification and criteria could also be because the authors did not dedicate a subheading to address the methodology used in the study, it was only mentioned in the abstract. Therefore there is need to dedicate a section of the manuscript to explain the methods.  Summary of review  The study is well articulated, comprehensive, detailed and addressed a very pressing social problem that cannot be over emphasized in Africa and especially Nigeria.  The conclusion was precise and drawn from the research findings and the recommendations are apt, Approve for publications after minor corrections,","The article examines domestic violence prevalence in Nigeria and examines some other jurisdictions.   There is a need for diligent proofreading of the article.

Some parts of the article refer to statistical data and other scholarly work but there were no corresponding references. This needs to be addressed. For instance, the data on the percentage of men and women that experience domestic violence was not referenced.  The claim that daughters and grand-daughters are taught to normalize domestic violence and GBV should be revised to reflect the position of male children. Does preferential treatment also suggest that male children are taught to believe and exert domination over females? Is that also a way of normalizing domestic violence for male children which contributes to the unbroken chain?  Reference to domestic violence in Ghana suggests that things have changed but there is no indication throughout the paper on what has changed and if any progress has been made in Ghana. This leaves a gap in the mind of the reader on what that aspect tends to communicate.   The claim that there is no data on domestic violence in India should be revisited. There is a difference between lack of data and inadequate or inaccurate data.   Reliance on data from a 1995-1998 survey to take a position on domestic violence in America is outdated. Does that suggest that nothing has been done since 1998 that will change the statistics? Also, the discussion of domestic violence in America under a sub-heading that suggests that the section is focused on Europe is misleading.   On page 7, the position that domestic violence is a ground for divorce in Nigeria should be changed to reflect that domestic violence can be claimed to prove that a marriage has broken down irretrievable. The only ground for divorce of statutory marriage is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Also, the reference on this note (42) should be corrected to section 15(2)(e) and not 15(1)(e) of the MCA.  The claim of the one-sided right to divorce in Islamic marriage should be reviewed. The authors may argue on the imbalance or inequality in divorce rights and not one-sided rights. It is important to compare the concept of talaq and khul to effectively make this argument.   The author's position on marital rape needs to be updated. Though, under sections 6 & 357 of the Criminal Code Act and section 382(2) of the Penal Code Act, marital rape is not recognized as a crime. However, the authors should evaluate this argument in line with VAPPA, ACJA, and the Constitution. Section 42(2) of the VAPPA is important in resolving conflict of laws in this regard. Though the authors made reference to this towards the end of the paper, this is a very important argument and should flow appropriately.   On the gender perspective of domestic violence in Nigeria, the authors needs to review the general application of the VAPPA to all persons irrespective of the nature of the marriage entered into.   The claim that the authorities often ignored cases of IPV in Nigeria is misleading. Several reports from the appropriate government agencies, NGOs, and INGOs show otherwise. Institutional restructuring across Nigeria also shows otherwise. For instance, in recent times, many police stations now have a gender desk with officers constantly trained to empower them in responding to domestic violence and GBV cases. Advocacy work is also evident in this area. The effectiveness and progress made may be worth evaluating.   The authors claim that only four states in Nigeria have enacted laws on domestic violence whereas the corresponding reference shows about 8 states. Presently, almost 20 states have taken legislative and policy steps directly and indirectly on domestic violence in Nigeria. There is a need to refer to current literature on this aspect in order to provide an up to date information.   The conclusion of a scholarly work should basically give a summary of what has been done and not introduce something new that was not discussed in the paper. The authors should reflect on this and avoid introducing new elements in the conclusion. Also, avoid making reference to other works in the conclusion and recommendations since these parts are expected to be solely your work.   Finally, the authors' voices were missing from the paper. There is a need to clearly take a position that reflects the stand of the authors.","The article presents a panoramic perspective of the socio-legal imperative of domestic violence prohibition in the African Continent with particular reference to Nigeria. It makes a comparative analysis of the occurrences of the menace of domestic violence in different socio-cultural settings particularly in India and Nigeria which have similar socio-political characteristics.  The article is clear, easy to understand and unequivocally addresses the social and legal issues it aims to achieve. It is my calculated opinion that the article is publishable and definitely contributes to knowledge especially as domestic violence in Nigeria is concerned.  It is, however, suggested that the recommendations articulated by the authors should be written in paragraphs or enumerated instead of the dotted symbols used.","The revisions made are in order, kindly index the article. Thank you.","Abstract  Secondary data and not tertiary is preferably used.  The result or findings section of the abstract should incorporate more findings made by the study.  Introduction  The introduction of the paper was quite elaborate and well-articulated. However there is need for a proper gap identification that will help the readers understand the focal point of study.  Objective of this study  There is need for clarity on the objective of the study as that will help to guide the focus of the study.  An analysis of domestic violence incidents in Africa and other selected countries  Under this subheading, the authors projected legal framework around domestic violence as it were in the traditional societies and failed to project the current move by different countries to ameliorate the menace of domestic violence.  Domestic violence is no longer a hush-hush issue as it were in the past. The culture of silence over domestic violence has been broken, many people are beginning to speak out. Similarly the paper should also look into the roles of some of the treaties many of the aforementioned African counties are signatory to that has also helped to reduce domestic violence.  Similarly some states in Nigeria have also adopted more stringent sanctions and panel codes for some types of gender based violence, the functionality and effectiveness of some of the laws should also be interrogated.  Asian continent with a focus on India as the selected country  Under this subheading and in the previous one, the authors should justify the reasons for selection of India among all the Asian countries. Similarly, the criteria used for the selection of some of the countries under discuss should also be made clear.  The lack of clarity in the justification and criteria could also be because the authors did not dedicate a subheading to address the methodology used in the study, it was only mentioned in the abstract. Therefore there is need to dedicate a section of the manuscript to explain the methods.  Summary of review  The study is well articulated, comprehensive, detailed and addressed a very pressing social problem that cannot be over emphasized in Africa and especially Nigeria.  The conclusion was precise and drawn from the research findings and the recommendations are apt, Approve for publications after minor corrections,",
"Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, and Mental Health Literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS): A preliminary evaluation of suicide prevention",0.0,"This is a valuable piece of work considering the high prevalence of suicidal behaviour in this population, however there are a few issues that I suggest to address:  Please support this statement 'the participants had little knowledge about psychiatry and suicide because they were second-year undergraduates'.   I have great concerns about labelling an intervention as 'suicide prevention' when the training materials are about mental health literacy as it is based on the (north-European/American) biomedical model of suicide that sees suicide fundamentally as caused by mental illness. This belief is contested by cultural/global mental health and critical suicidology scholars and the authors must justify their decision to develop a training based on the English speaking countries MHFA, when they also had the option, for instance, to use the tool that was specifically developed for Japan but is not even mentioned in the article, i.e. Colucci et al., 20111.   Similarly measuring depression as distal measurement for suicide is based on the same assumption indicated above and the authors should show first of all awareness of this belief and second justify it (and paper contains many of these assumptions as demonstrated by this statement 'Surprisingly, this reduction in suicidal ideation was not accompanied by marked changes in depression severity scores').   The limitations section should include the limitations stated above, namely that the authors used MH literacy instead of suicide literacy specifically.  This paper presents data from a gatekeeper program in Japan with undergraduate medical students. There are many strengths of the paper, including that it is well-written, with clear methodology and presentation of results. It also includes several key outcome variables, including suicide risk, depression, and changes in stigma, attitudes, and awareness, encompassing many of the critical outcomes in this type of work. Other prior studies have not examined all of these interesting outcomes. However, there are a few minor issues that could strengthen the paper.  First, for an international audience, it may be helpful to describe the “undergraduate medical student” sample, as medical school is a professional school that comes after an undergraduate education in many Western countries.  Second, there are some minor concerns about the interpretation of the results that should be addressed. Specifically, the changes in the suicide measure are presented in a way that is either confusing or may distort the magnitude of the change. I would suggest reporting a dichotomous cutoff of high risk v low risk, in which the authors put people into two categories pre-intervention and follow-up, and then do a chi-square test so there can be an actual inferential statistic there. Also, the description of the depression scores improving though non-statistically significantly should be changed to “no significant improvement” – the change was very small and the effect size was 0, so it is misleading to say there was any change.  Otherwise, I think this is a nice paper that makes a contribution to the literature.","This is a valuable piece of work considering the high prevalence of suicidal behaviour in this population, however there are a few issues that I suggest to address:  Please support this statement 'the participants had little knowledge about psychiatry and suicide because they were second-year undergraduates'.   I have great concerns about labelling an intervention as 'suicide prevention' when the training materials are about mental health literacy as it is based on the (north-European/American) biomedical model of suicide that sees suicide fundamentally as caused by mental illness.

Reliability of the 44-question Home Fall Hazard Assessment Tool and personal characteristics associated with home hazards among the Thai elderly,0.25,"This article has been improved, but being viewed with fresh eyes, there are some issues that need to be addressed by authors.  Major issue: What was the reason that fall related personal characteristics were not included in the study using regression? Age, past falls, past fall injuries, physical and cognitive function, balance/dizziness, foot problems, alcohol intake, incontinence, vision and hearing problems, high bald pressure, etc. It looks like you have information about some of them. If you are interested in demographic factors only, you should have controlled for these fall risk factors that are known to cause a fall. To do so, you need more than 51 participants to use a regression analysis.  Minor issues: These are mainly for writing clarifications and are easy to fix.  Abstract  1. In Background, use the word “demographic” rather than “personal” characteristic because in Methods, only sex, occupation, and education are mentioned. Why was age not included?  2. Choose either “interrater” or “inter-rater”.  3. In Results, the p-value should be less than .05. If it is significantly related, it should be p≤.05; therefore, it is not necessary to talk about it. Revise the sentence to something such as “In demographic variables, business career and education level (grades 1-3) had significant relations with the total number of home hazards in the 44-questions Thai-HFHAT.”  Introduction  4. Words such as “the elderly” and “elderly” are not preferred terms. Use “older adults”, instead. This is for the whole manuscript.  5. Can you be a little more specific about poor housing conditions?  6. How many minutes does it take to complete the 69-question Thai HFHAT while 44-quesitons take 30 minutes?  Methods  7. In Study design, a description is only for interrater reliability. Write one for test-retest reliability. They are written in the Abstract.  8. Start a new sentence for determination of dementia using MMSE-Thai 2002 or follow my suggestion for # 12 below.  9. 51 should be spelled out. Same for 4 items in Research and 37, the beginning in Discussion when a sentence starts with a number.  10. The word “passed” should be replaced with “met”.  11. After “this number was adequate” it is better to say, “for our primary purpose – examining interrater and test-retest reliability.” It is because if you used only 51 participants for regression, it is not enough. The parts talking about the sample sizes are a bit confusing. Please clarify the sample size for each of three analyses. You had these 3 groups for interrater reliability study, which was one of the study strengths.  12. The information about MMSE-Thai 2002 is redundant with that in Participants. This part is easier to understand than in Participants section. It may be better to leave it something like “ had dementia determined by the Mini Mental State Examination-Thai 2002. Do you have the information about psychometric properties of MMSE-Thai 2002?  13. In Data collection, if participants were instructed to complete the assessment within 30 minutes, you have to revise the sentence In the Introduction, “requires only 30 minutes for elderly users to complete”. It is because we read the sentence that “older participants took 30 minutes to complete” and you are reporting the fact. The revised sentence should be “…was designed for older participants to complete it within 30 minutes.”  14. Were 51 older participants’ houses used for reliability tests?  15. Provide one or two examples of instructions or questions to identify a home hazard. Were they asked, “Isthis room lighted well?” “Does thisroom light well not to fall?”, etc.?  16. “So that reserachers could collect more data for examining test-rest reliability,” should be “for test-retest reliability.”  17. In Data analysis, citation (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) should be replaced with (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). IBM bought SPSS in 2009.  18. Was the test-retest performed for the three groups separately or altogether? Later I understood but it should be written here also.  19. Sentences starting with “Information bias” are not necessary. It should be covered by IRB. If you must write it for some reason, it should be placed in the Data collection section.  Results  20. Caregivers provided care about 22 hours/day on average. The hour seems extremely high even if care recipients have dementia.  21. In Table 2, 14 participants fell but in fall injury, 16 participants answered. The total should be 14. Also, the percentage should be calculated out of 14.  22. The result section should be written in past tense.  23. Is the sentence starting with “the area at the most risk of fall risk are…” 94.1% of 107? Revise the sentence, such as “The most home hazards that may cause a fall was found for the bathroom (94.1% of 107), then bedroom…” Did 94.1% of participants identify at least one of 4 items in the bathroom is a fall risk?  24. “The risk of falling in each room” and the title of Figure 1 should be replaced by for example “Percentage of identified home hazards that may cause a fall in each room.”  25. Who are participants for personal characteristics associated with home hazards? 51 older adults?  26. Why was age not included in independent variables? Please read a major concern.  27. In Table 3, all r should be R. Discussion 28. I would use (91.9% of 37 non-fallers) rather than (66.6%).  29. I would state “This figure supports the study by Hopewell….” rather than “Our results are consistent..” because this was not the purpose of the study and happened to find it.  30. Remove the last sentence of the first paragraph on page 8, staring “This makes it more reliable than….”. When raters are homogeneous, they tend to rate in a similar manner. In your study, the raters are diverse. Accordingly, the reference 26 should move after (ICC=0.74)” When we use 1 vs. K, the use of ICC(2,k) produces a larger ICC value than ICC (2,1). It is not always that a lager sample size produces a lower ICC value than a small sample size. When there is little variation among raters given to each item, then the ICC v values become high. Revision of these paragraphs related to the sample size and ICC values is recommended or if the statement is true, put citations.  31. You discussed a lot about interrater reliability but not much about test-retest reliability.  32. Finally, if you do have answers for my major concern, please state them and if not, you should state lack of control for known fall risks in the limitation. Thank you for your kind responses toward my comments. I am agreed with the revised version. The paper by Lektip et al. analysed the reliability of the 44-question Thai Home Fall Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) and determine the person characteristics associated with home hazards. This is an interesting study and the authors have collected a unique dataset using cutting edge methodology.  Overall, the information presented represents valuable information regarding the feasibility of using (Thai-HFHAT). The main strength of this paper is that it addresses an interesting question and finds a novel solution based on a carefully selected set of rules and provides a clear answer in culturally context. The paper is generally well written and structured. The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the text.  However, in my opinion the paper has some shortcomings regarding some data analyses and discussion. The number of subjects for VHV group is too small (5) as compared to other groups. This number is too small which may affect the analysis. I also suggested to add further information on caregiver and VHF personal characteristic to explain any important aspects contributing to the variation in (Thai-HFHAT) score. The purposes of the study are to establish reliability of 44-item home fall hazard assessment tool for Thai older adults and to find personal characteristics associated with the identified number of fall risks. The reliability section is done correctly but can be improved further.    One of the most comprehensive studies about reliability and validity of home hazard to prevent falls in older adults is missing1.    This study is a methodological study not cross-sectional.   A study replication cannot be done easily. Explain how the sample size was determined. Fifty-one is enough for inter-rater and test-retest reliability but not enough for a regression analysis. Make inclusion criteria of ADL and MMSE clearer. What are the compositions of 107 participants? Fifty-one older adults, 47 caregivers, and 5 VHS make only 103.    Personal characteristics should include those related to a fall risk, in addition to demographic information. For example, falls in past one year, no falls or no vicarious falls so far, experiences in fall related injury and hospitalization, MMSE and ADL scores, readiness to make home safer, dizziness, balance problems etc. should be included. However, the sample size is too small for a multiple regression.   In Discussion, ""...the group who were working in their own homes as housekeepers..."" does not make sense. Revise this sentence.    When we deal with human being for research, we use the word ""participants"" rather than ""subjects"". In Table 1, the statistical comparisons among these three groups are made; however, it is not the purpose of this study; therefore, they are not necessary. Descriptive statistics is sufficient.    Overall impression of this study is that authors may be able to do more meaningful analyses using existing data for the personal characteristics part, although it has to be based on hypotheses derived from literature review.  ","This article has been improved, but being viewed with fresh eyes, there are some issues that need to be addressed by authors.

However, the sample size is too small for a multiple regression.   In Discussion, ""...the group who were working in their own homes as housekeepers..."" does not make sense. Revise this sentence.    When we deal with human being for research, we use the word ""participants"" rather than ""subjects"". In Table 1, the statistical comparisons among these three groups are made; however, it is not the purpose of this study; therefore, they are not necessary. Descriptive statistics is sufficient.    Overall impression of this study is that authors may be able to do more meaningful analyses using existing data for the personal characteristics part, although it has to be based on hypotheses derived from literature review.  ",

The dosage of thiopental as pharmacological cerebral protection during non-shunt carotid endarterectomy: A retrospective study,0.0,"The authors retrospectively evaluated the optimal dosage of thiopental required to induce burst suppression during non-shunt carotid endarterectomy. As an analysis of 57 patients, the authors concluded the optimal dosage of thiopental required to achieve burst suppression on intraoperative EEG was 26.3+10.1 mg/kg/hr. This is interesting clinical data. However, there are several concerns which should be clarified.  In all patients, non-shunt technique was used. How did the authors evaluate that these patients would not require shunt during carotid clamping? Were there patients in which poor collateral flow was expected during the carotid clamping? Please mention the method of preoperative assessment.  Based on the results of this study, the outcome of the patients was similar. In addition, previous animal study indicated that burst suppression is not necessary to achieve neuroprotective effect of thiopental (Schmid-Elsaesser et al. (1999)1). So, this reviewer doubts that burst suppression is really required during the clamping of carotid artery. The authors should mention the rationale to get burst suppression on EEG. Please add the data that burst suppression would be required to have neuroprotective effects.

Strategy to identify the function during carotid clamp is also important to prevent postoperative neurological dysfunction. Under the burst suppression on EEG, assessment of function can be disturbed.    Finally, based on the data of this study, what did the authors recommend as a strategy to use thiopental during carotid clamping? Considering the necessity of burst suppression for neuroprotection, the conclusion should be carefully drawn.","The authors retrospectively evaluated the optimal dosage of thiopental required to induce burst suppression during non-shunt carotid endarterectomy.

Investigating the circulating sphingolipidome response to a single high-intensity interval training session within healthy females and males in their twenties (SphingoHIIT): Protocol for a randomised controlled trial,0.5,"Dear Dr Carrard  Thank you very much for your answers to my initial comments. Everything is properly addressed and now completely clear.  I wish you good luck successfully conducting your study and I am looking forward to seeing your published study results. The manuscript of Carrard and colleagues describes the study protocol for an investigation on the relationship between S1p and exercise training and whether this biomarker is modified by exercise training. It is a pilot RCT. The rationale, study plan and also statistical plans are convincing in general. I highly appreciate that the authors also utilized DAGs for determining possible analysis adjustments. The whole manuscript is written in a comprehensive, straightforward way and easy to follow by the reader.  However, I still have some minor remarks that should be addressed:  Sample size calculation: please provide additional details / information on the utilized software packages and if possible also the utilized code. It is not clear to me, whether the assumed effect size of 1.19 is only the post-treatment geometric group mean ratio? Or is it the assumed ratio between the pre-post changes of both groups? I tried to recapitulate the calculation made here and I always reached larger group sizes than 16.   Statistical analysis: Since this is a randomized trial you should not include into the linear mixed effects model a main effect for the treatment group. The treatment group should be only included in the interaction term with timepoints itself. Randomization implies there is no group difference at baseline pre treatment, so both groups have the same intercept. Treatment can only causally act after the baseline timepoint.   Just as a minor remark, sphingolipids and ceramides are presented in the introduction only as having detrimental effects especially in the cell/molecular mechanism part. The literature is not clear so far to my knowledge e.g. how chain length of ceramides are related to CRF and CV risk. It seems that short chain ceramides have more ""detrimental"" effects while very long chain ceramides seem to have also ""positive"" effects. Saturation seems to play also a role: C24:0 is more positively associated with CRF and inversely with CVD mortality while C24:1 seems to be different. C16/C24 ratio is inversely associated with mortality and risk of CV incident events. See e.g. Peterson et al., (2018)1. So maybe include 1-2 sentences into the introduction or discussion that the mechanistic picture is rather complex and it depends about which sphingolipid/ceramide in terms of chain-length and saturation we are speaking.  After minor revision it should be accepted and I wish the authors good luck with conducting the study.

"The genome sequence of the Loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta Linnaeus 1758",0.5,"This manuscript describes the sequencing and annotation of the Caretta caretta genome, which is already available in public data bases. It is a high quality genome that for sure is positively impacting the sea turtles community.  The analyses are appropriate and results are sound (despite I miss more details, see below). A high percentage of contigs were assembled into chromosomes, and assembled chromosomes overall showed conserved synteny with the green turtle.  I found surprising that there is no information about repetitive elements. Where they annotated? I strongly recommend to report the levels and type of repetitive elements found within the genome. They can be easily annotated using the repeatMasker software.  In the abstract I recommend to briefly report the quality of the genome assembly, for instance by adding the percentage of complete BUSCO.  Despite genome notes are short by definition, in general I miss more details of how analyses were performed. For instance, there is no information of the parameters used when running the programs and it is not explained how the syntenic analyses were performed, neither the annotation of the genome.  Regarding the annotation of the genome, I do not understand this sentence, “The loggerhead sea turtle assembly was also annotated for 54,583 protein sequences using RefSeq (GCF_023653815.1, PRJNA853764)” since there are 19,633 protein coding genes annotated in Ensembl.  The mitochondrial genome is not reported in this genome note but it is provided in NCBI. I think it should be mentioned here including the tools that were used for its assembly and annotation. Chang et al. present a chromosomal genome assembly of the Loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, using a combination of Nanopore long reads, HiC and Illumina. The conservation importance of having a genome assembly for this globally distributed but vulnerable species is made very clear.  As the second chromosomal assembly of a marine turtle it is informative to see a synteny plot comparing this to the green sea turtle, Chelonia midas. This highlights the strongly conserved synteny, similarity in overall assembly span and relative chromosome sizes between these species while maintaining the concise focussed approach typical of a Genome Note.  Overall the article was very clearly presented, however the presentation of summary information about the 2 sets of gene annotation was slightly inconsistent and I found myself referring to the RefSeq annotation page to compare the numbers of coding vs no-coding genes with the values presented for the Ensembl annotation.","This manuscript describes the sequencing and annotation of the Caretta caretta genome, which is already available in public data bases.

Changing the method of consent to increase the numbers of cadaveric donors in Saudi Arabia: the autonomy paradox,-1.0,"This is an improved version of the article. I appreciate the authors’ effort to address my concerns. However, several important issues remain. In particular, the justification for the recommendation to change the consent model to a mandatory choice system is confused from an argumentative point of view. Furthermore, the article does not provide sufficient evidence or good enough reasons to support the potential effectiveness of this change in achieving its objective.  First, the recommendation of changing the consent system to address organ shortage is not sufficiently justified.   In the introduction, the article states that ""family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation"" (33% of family consent in 2019) and that the ""unknown wish of the donor is one of the reasons for the families' refusal to consent"". Although this second claim is not based on studies of the Saudi population, it is very plausible. [By the way, a systematic review of bioethics in Saudi Arabia, including 33 studies on organ donation and transplantation, was published very recently and might contain relevant data to support this second claim (Woodman et al. 2022). I encourage the authors to consult this review if they have not already done so.] The article then states that ""to overcome this issue, improvements should be made in documenting potential donors' consent in organ donation registries"".  So far, the rationale seems to be that since the shortage of transplantable organs is partly caused by high rates of family refusal, which is partly caused by unknown individual wishes, then improving the registration of individuals’ wishes may decrease family refusal rates and might, as a consequence, increase organ procurement. So far, so good.  Then, the article introduces opt-in, opt-out and mandatory choice and states that ""This paper aims to analyze the different types of consent systems to address the issue of the high rate of family refusal […]"". There is an argumentative gap here. It is as if changing the consent model is the only possible solution to mitigate the problem of family refusals caused by unknown individual wishes. However, we know there are alternative policies that could be implemented. So, why are the authors focusing on this one alone? Is it supposed to be more effective, or easier to implement, or cheaper than alternative policies?  In other words, among all the policies that could be implemented to try to increase individual registration and decrease family refusals, why is the article focusing only on changing the consent system?  Second, the recommendation to move to a mandatory choice system is not adequately justified.   We will consider the three main reasons to move from opt-in to mandatory choice: effectiveness, ethics, and public support.  Effectiveness  First, the article correctly mentions that the opt-in system is arguably not the most effective (in terms of converting willing donors into actual donors) because, in Saudi Arabia as in several other countries, many individuals do not document their willingness to donate.  Then, the article suggests that the opt-out system is more effective by citing Rithalia and colleagues’ (2009) systematic review of the impact of opt-out. However, the article fail to mention that this study does not necessarily lead to this conclusion. According to Rithalia and colleagues: ""The available evidence suggests that presumed consent is associated with increased organ donation rates, even when other factors are accounted for. However, it cannot be inferred from this that the introduction of presumed consent legislation per se will lead to an increase in organ donation rates."" (Rithalia 2009, p.7)  There are more recent studies and reviews on this topic. Some support the idea that moving from opt-in to opt-out contributes to increasing organ donation rates. Others don’t. At this time, this issue is not settled yet.  Finally, the article mentions that implementing a mandated choice system and using the Tawakkalna app for this could increase the number of registered donors. The article also warns that ""there is sparse evidence on the effectiveness of a mandated choice system in increasing the number of registered donors"". Then, the article mentions a mandated choice policy in Australia that was discontinued because it was not successful.  It is quite obvious that individuals who want to donate their organs are more likely to register their consent in a mandatory choice system than in an opt-in system, because they are required to register their wishes. As a consequence, families are more likely to know the deceased’s wishes. However, individuals who do not want to donate are also more likely to register their refusal in a mandatory choice system than in an opt-in system. Although registered consents will increase, registered refusals will increase too. Therefore, there is no guarantee that moving from opt-in to mandatory choice will lead to increased organ donation rates.   The recommendation of this article works on the paper, but it may not work in the real life. This article does not provide sufficient arguments or evidence to suggest that it might actually work. Arguably, changing legislation should not be a game of trial and error. As said in the abstract: ""more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions of organ donation to ensure feasibility.""   Ethics  The article claims that a mandatory choice system might be the optimal solution in terms of balance between the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of the family in Saudi Arabia. So, why is it better than opt-in and opt-out?  When examining the opt-in system from this perspective, the authors write the following:  ""Some argue that an opt-in system respects personal autonomy since this policy can ensure that the individual's wishes to become a donor is acknowledged (Farsides, 2012; Taylor, 2005). On the other hand, opponents of opt-in policies state that it could undermine autonomy by harvesting organs from unwilling donors who did not document their wishes. (Gill, 2004).""  The second sentence is wrong: under an opt-in system those individuals who did not document their wishes are not considered as potential organ donors, because by definition in order to be considered as a potential donor, they must have opted in. By contrast, it is true that, under an opt-out system, organ can be procured from individuals who didn’t want to donate but failed to express their refusal.  When examining the opt-out system, the authors write the following:   ""A presumed consent system is ethically sound and may not violate autonomy; nevertheless, there are some concerns.""  There is a heated debate in the literature with regard to the ethical acceptability of presumed consent and whether or not it is respectful of individual autonomy. The very idea that someone’s consent could be presumed is problematic. Therefore, I wonder what reasons lead the authors to claim that presumed consent is ethically sound and may not violate autonomy.  The article then mentions that ""the presumption of consent is ’morally no worse than not removing organs from the bodies of people who did want them removed’ (Gill, 2004)"". This sentence confuses two distinct issues. On the one hand, Michael Gill shows that there is presumption on both sides: opt-out presumes willingness to donate, opt-in presumes unwillingness to donate. There is no particular moral issue there. On the other hand, Gill argues that removing organs from the bodies of people who did not want them removed (opt-out) is ""morally no worse than not removing organs from the bodies of people who did want them removed"".  Eventually, the article mentions the following:   ""However, applying a presumed consent policy in the context of Saudi Arabia might be unfeasible due to ethical considerations pertaining to the role of families. In many cases, the family trumps an individuals' autonomy (Al-Shahri, 2002). Therefore, it may be culturally insensitive to implement a presumed consent system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely, which could risk public acceptance.""  There is a leap of argument between the second sentence and the third. The second sentence mentions the fact that the family can overrule the deceased’s wishes (trump an individual’s autonomy). This is actually quite common around the world and not specific to Saudi Arabia (Rosenblum et al. 2012; Delgado et al. 2019). The third sentence mentions that an opt-out system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely could risk public acceptance. Ok, but what about implementing an opt-out system that does not disregard the wishes of the next of kin? These soft opt-out systems are very common worldwide (Rosenblum et al. 2012; Delgado et al. 2019). If the family in Saudi Arabia is allowed to have the last word in the decision-making process under the opt-in system, the family may be allowed to have the last word under an opt-out system too. Besides, the authors’ remark would also apply to a mandated choice system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely.  When examining the mandated choice system, the article mentions that ""requiring people to make a choice could undermine autonomy by taking away the right not to choose"" and that ""nevertheless […], it increases a person's likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination"". So, mandated choice encourages self-determination by taking away people’s right not to decide. Whether this is morally better or worse than the opt-in system is debatable.  Public support  Finally, the article mentions that ""a study conducted in Saudi Arabia ranked mandated choice as the most favored consent system"", but warns that ""the study was limited to a single tertiary hospital, and nation-wide studies must be conducted to further validate this finding"".  Summary  To summarise the rationale used in this article to recommend a mandated choice system: (1) It is unclear whether or not a mandated choice system would be more effective in increasing organ donation; (2) It is debatable whether a mandated choice system is morally better than opt-in; and (3) there is some but insufficient evidence to support that people in Saudi Arabia would prefer a mandated choice system better than opt-in, opt-out.  This is not a compelling rationale.   MINOR ISSUES  ""This result was partially due to the opposition to this system's potential to increase the number of donors who opt-out of being a donor."" --> I don't understand this sentence.  ""One of the main obstacles to obtaining family consent in Saudi Arabia is family refusal."" --> I don't know what this sentence is supposed to mean. That ""family refusal is the main obstacle to family consent"" is analytically true. This is a nicely written paper that argues in favor of using mandated choice to increase the availability of transplant organs in Saudi Arabia. While it does not cover any new ground in its ethical discussion it provides helpful information about the ways in which new technology might be used to enhance organ procurement. However, it suffers from significant empirical and theoretical weaknesses that preclude its indexing as it stands, including inaccurate data, claims that are insufficiently supported by evidence and a poor grounding in philosophical ethics and action theory. I have provided an overview of these issues below.  Issue 1:  “According to a news article, the number of registered donors increased from 20,000 to 200,000, which is a 115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature.”  Three points are worth noting here:  Is there a better source for these figures than a news article? Have the authors examined the original source on which this news article was based? How accurate is this claim?   The increase from 20,000 to 200,000 is not “115%” as the authors claim. This needs to be corrected.   When the authors write “…115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature” do they mean that this 115% increase was immediate after the launch, and then numbers further increased, or do they mean to claim that the increase to 200,000 occurred in the total time after the launch? (The former construal would be compatible with there being an initial increase of 115% and then an greater increase subsequently.)  Issue 2:  “As for ethical considerations, the current opt-in system respects an individual's autonomy. According to Immanuel Kant, undermining a person's autonomy is to treat that person as a mere means to an end without regard for the individual's own goals. Based on Kant's theory, organs from a deceased individual should not be harvested if the person's wish was not to be a donor, even if it intends to save others.”  There are three points that should be made with respect to the claims in this sentence.  The authors should distinguish between personal autonomy and Kantian autonomy. On a theory of personal autonomy a person is autonomous with respect to her desires and actions if they flow from her motivational set in a way that ensures that they originate from her, rather than from elsewhere (where the requirements for what counts as originating from her are spelled out in the theory of personal autonomy that one adopts). On a Kantian account of autonomy a person is autonomous if (roughly) she acts out of respect for the moral law. These are distinct accounts of autonomy, and since the former is often of primary interest in discussions of organ procurement the authors would do well to focus on it rather than its Kantian alternative.   Why couldn’t an opt-out approach to organ procurement also respect a person’s (personal) autonomy? The authors should see here Michael Gill’s “Presumed Consent, Autonomy, and Organ procurement,” Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 29, 1 (2004): 37 – 591.   Merely claiming that Kant would hold that a person’s organs should not be harvested after her death if she did not agree to this is insufficient. The authors need to argue that Kant (or Kantians) are committed to holding that persons have duties to respect the wishes of the dead.   Issue 3:  The authors should note that the differences in the effectiveness of the Austrian and Spanish systems might also be a product of differing infrastructure that is in place to secure available organs, and not merely the result of their different approaches to opt-out systems. The authors also need to provide better sources for their claims here.  Issue 4:  “According to a study conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2018, most participants support organ donation…” - What percentage is captured by “most”?  Issue 5:  “As for ethical considerations, a mandated choice system makes the two choices readily available; it increases a person's likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination.”  Why does requiring persons to make a choice between two alternatives increase her “…likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination”? Indeed, couldn’t requiring that a person choose between two alternatives decrease the degree to which she is autonomous with respect to her relevant choices, insofar as it removes from her the option not to choose — an option which some persons might have preferred? The authors need to do much more to support their claims here, especially since they appear prima facie implausible. The article first describes the organ donation system in Saudi Arabia and identifies the high rate of family opposition as one major obstacle to increasing cadaveric organ donation rates in the country. Then, the article presents the three main consent policies: opt-in (explicit consent), opt-out (presumed consent), and mandated choice, advocating for the latter one as the best alternative in the context of Saudi Arabia.  Overall, the article is well written and provides a clear and accessible overview of the consent policy alternatives. One interesting point mentioned in the article is the use of the Tawakkalna app as a means of registration of individual preferences about organ donation. However, the article lacks depth in its analysis and suffers from some mistakes and inaccuracies that need to be addressed.  ""Does the paper provide a comprehensive overview of the policy and the context of its implementation in a way which is accessible to a general reader?""   Only partly. The overview is accessible to a general reader but it is not comprehensive and it lacks depth in its analysis. Also, its main hypothesis is based on insufficient evidence.  For instance, after mentioning that only 33% of approached families authorised in 2019 the retrieval of organs from their loved ones, the article claims that the relatives’ lack of knowledge of the deceased’s wishes as one of the main reasons for the families’ refusal. [By the way, the wording of the sentence beginning ""Lack of knowledge of the potential donor…"" should be revised.] This second claim is based on Palmer 2012. Although this reference appears to be a good review of the literature, it has not been peer-reviewed. In addition, it is also relatively outdated (meaning that other reviews have been conducted more recently) and the studies reviewed were conducted mostly in English speaking Western countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, which means that their conclusions may not necessarily be extensible to other cultural contexts such as Saudi Arabia. In other words, although it may be true that lack of knowledge by the family is, in these countries, one of the main reasons for their refusal, there is no guarantee that the same conclusion holds in other countries, especially when these countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia) have a different social organization, religion, and cultural background.  Since the argument of the article is based on the claim that family refusals are mainly caused by the family’s lack of knowledge of the potential donor wishes (which could be addressed, according to the authors, by a mandated choice policy), stronger evidence is needed to support this claim, especially in the context of Saudi Arabia. In other words, authors should provide more updated and compelling evidence that this claim is true—or, at the very least, that it may be true in their country—before proposing a policy to address it.   There is a rich and vast literature of empirical studies on the factors of family decision-making and willingness/refusal to donate that are contemporary or posterior to Palmer 2012.

Progress in Transplantation 2013;23:99–104.14  After mentioning the lack of evidence as ""one of the main reasons for the families’ refusal to consent"", the authors write: ""To overcome this issue, improvements should be made in documenting potential donors’ consent in organ donation registries."" This conclusion does not necessarily follow or only partially. There are several other means to address family refusal rates, on the one hand, and the lack of knowledge issue, on the other. These means include mass media campaigns, targeted educational campaigns, the presence of a Specialist Nurse for Organ Donation (SNOD) as it is done in the UK, extensive training of transplant coordinators for the family interview as it is done in Spain, financial incentives to donation, prioritization programmes as it is done in Israel, etc. Some countries (e.g. Germany) with much lower family refusal rates than Saudi Arabia, do not have an organ donation registry but only an organ donor card. Other countries (e.g. Spain) with very low family refusal rates, do not have any registry at all (except for living wills that are barely used in practice for registering organ donation preferences) nor any official organ donor card. Fostering communication about organ donation among relatives and training the medical staff to conduct the family interview are alternative ways to increase family knowledge without requiring the registration or documentation of individual preferences.  In the next paragraph, the article says: ""There are three known methods of consent when registering to become a donor upon death: informed consent (opt-in system), mandated choice and presumed consent (opt-out system)."" This wording is confusing. First, the opt-in system is not based on informed consent but only on explicit or expressed consent. Second, although the opt-out system is compatible with a registry of refusals, presumed consent only applies when no registering has taken place. Third, it is important to differentiate the models of individual consent (informed, presumed) and consent policies (opt-in, opt-out, mandated choice) from the means available to individuals to express their consent or refusal to donate. Some countries have registries, others don’t, regardless of their consent policy.  The article then states its main objective: ""This paper aims to analyze the different types of consent systems to address the issue of the high rate of family refusal. The study offers some important insights that will aid decision-makers in selecting an alternative that is more likely to reduce the shortage of organs.""  This objective presupposes that there is a causal relationship between the consent systems and the rates of family refusal. I would recommend the authors provide references or data to support such an assumption. I ignore whether this is the case or not and whether there is at least a correlation between the two. I am really curious about it. By looking at the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation’s Newsletter Transplant 2017, which provides data on family refusal in many countries throughout the world, I fail prima facie to see any trend that may be related to the consent systems in place.  With regard to the article’s proposal of a mandated choice policy, it is true that if registering a preference in favour or against organ donation was mandatory in the country, this would likely increase the registration rates and decrease the families’ lack of knowledge about their loved one’s wishes. As a consequence, the number of family refusals caused by this lack of knowledge would also likely decrease. Question is: first, is this the best way to increase organ donation rates and, second, how many family refusals are actually caused by lack of knowledge in Saudi Arabia?  To answer these questions, it would be good to give some perspective. According to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, Saudi Arabia had a deceased organ donation rate of 3.3 pmp in 2019 and 1.9 pmp in 2020, which is relatively low although not in the lower end of the ranking. In 2017, according to the same source, Saudi Arabia had a population of 32.2 M and a total of 92 deceased donors, that is, a rate of 2.9 donors pmp; 333 family interviews were conducted asking for authorisation, out of which 230 (69%) refused. The article mentions that, according to a 2009 study of Saudi University students, ""about 70% of participants are willing to become donors"". If this figure was representative of the general population, if all individuals had registered their wishes, if all families of those willing to donate authorised organ procurement, and if all potential donors were eventually converted into actual donors, the total number of donors in 2017 would have been 92 + (333 x 70%) = 325, increasing the donors rate to 10% which is much better (comparable to that of Germany that same year). [Another study (Alnasyan et al. 2019) also cited in the article but whose figures on willingness to donate are not mentioned by the article says that 77.7% of the general public expressed a willingness to donate, although 29.1% were willing to donate only to their relatives]  The problem is that we don’t know how likely is such a scenario. There are no data provided in the article regarding how many of the family refusals were caused by lack of knowledge or by other reasons such as those cited in Palmer 2012: Not wishing for surgery to the body/having concerns regarding disfigurement; Feelings that the patient had suffered enough; Disagreements among the family group; Religious/cultural reasons; Dissatisfaction with healthcare staff and process; Concerns over delay to funeral/burial process; Unable to accept death, or lack of understanding of brain death; Concerns regarding the integrity of process e.g. unfair organ allocation of organs and organ selling; Relatives deciding themselves that organs would not be suitable; Longstanding negative views on organ donation; Relatives were emotionally exhausted.  Actually, the article itself mentions that some unknown proportion of the family refusals may not be caused by lack of knowledge: ""It is important to note that, under the current policy, families still have the right to veto that decision despite their loved one’s consent to become a donor."" Also: ""In many cases, the family trumps an individual’s autonomy (Al-Shahri, 2002)"" The reference here cited (Al-Shahri, 2002) says ""In Saudi culture, the authority of the family overrules the individuals’ autonomy. Decisions taken by patients can often be altered according to the views of the family"". I am thus curious to know the proportion of families who veto the deceased’s consent as well as their reasons to do so, because this is not caused by lack of knowledge of the deceased’s wishes, and some of the families who do lack knowledge may share the same reasons to refuse as those who don’t.  Is the discussion on the implications clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?  The discussion on the implications is quite clear but it lacks accuracy and it does not cite enough updated and relevant literature.  For example, the authors mention that ""According to a news article, the number of registered donors increased from 20,000 to 200,000, which is a 115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature"". This is a ten-fold increase and definitely not a 115% increase. Something is wrong. I checked (using an automated translator) the news article cited here and it seems that these figures are actually mentioned. I failed to see any sources cited in the news article. This tells me that this news article is not reliable and thus it is not worth citing in a scientific article. Anyway, even if the 20,000 to 200,000 increase in registrations was true, compared to more than 34 M inhabitants in 2021, this represents only 0.6% of the total population. This is much better, but still anecdotal.  Another example. The article claims that ""after adopting a hard opt-out policy in Austria, the rate of donations quadrupled within eight years (Zink et al., 2005). On the other hand, a soft approach to the policy did not impact donation rates in Spain, which indicates that a hard opt-out policy could be more effective."" There are several problems here. First, the reference cited with regard to Austria does not provide any evidence for the claim but cites two other sources, one of which15 makes this claim without any evidence or references provided. This claim may be true or it may not, but the reference cited here is not sufficient to support the claim. Second, with regard to Spain, the policy is soft in clinical practice but hard according to the law. Third, what did impact donation rates in Spain was not the implementation of an opt-out policy in 1979, but the creation of the National Transplant Organisation (ONT) in 1989. Fourth, it is odd to claim that a hard opt-out policy (such as in Austria) could be more effective than a soft opt-out policy (such as in Spain) considering that Spain has a much higher donation rate (49.6 pmp in 2019) than Austria (23.4 pmp in 2019) according to the GODT. Fifth, several studies, including systematic reviews, have explored the impact of presumed consent policies. They should be cited.  One more example. The article mentions ""a study in the Netherlands, a country that adopted a mandated choice, concluded that this system generated more registered donors than both informed and presumed consent systems (Van Dalen & Henkens, 2014)."" First, the Netherlands had not adopted a mandated choice policy but an opt-in system (as the authors of the cited study clearly state in their article). Second, the Netherlands have recently implemented an opt-out system. Third, the cited study does not assess the actual performance of a mandated choice system in the country but compares, in an experimental setting using counterfactuals, whether people would register as donors (hypothetically) if they moved to a region with presumed consent, explicit consent, or mandated choice. Fourth, the results from this study show that people would be more willing to register as donors under a mandated choice system (66%), but this result is only 4 points higher than presumed consent (62%) and many more people would also refuse to donate under a mandated choice system (34%) than under a presumed consent system (18%). In other words, mandated choice would increase donors by 4% and non-donors by 16% when compared to presumed consent.  Are the recommendations made clear, balanced, and justified on the basis of the presented arguments?  The first recommendation is changing the method of obtaining consent from opt-in to mandated choice. Considering the comments above, it is not sufficiently justified. The authors may want to look at a similar recommendation made in other countries, such as a law proposal (unsuccessful) made by members of the German Parliament (see http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/110/1911087.pdf, text in German), as well as the report on organ donation by the Swiss National Human Medical Ethics Commission (see https://www.nek-cne.admin.ch/inhalte/Themen/Stellungnahmen/fr/NEK-Stellungnahme_Organspende_FR.pdf, text in French).  The second recommendation refers to modifying the Tawakkalna App. The proposed modifications may be useful, provided that more people register their organ donation preferences in the app.   The third recommendation or part of it is sensible: ""more research dedicated to assessing the feasibility of implementing a new consent system"", as well as ""understanding the current Saudi context"" to predict [I would say, estimate] its success.","This is an improved version of the article. I appreciate the authors’ effort to address my concerns. However, several important issues remain. In particular, the justification for the recommendation to change the consent model to a mandatory choice system is confused from an argumentative point of view. Furthermore, the article does not provide sufficient evidence or good enough reasons to support the potential effectiveness of this change in achieving its objective.  First, the recommendation of changing the consent system to address organ shortage is not sufficiently justified.   In the introduction, the article states that ""family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation"" (33% of family consent in 2019) and that the ""unknown wish of the donor is one of the reasons for the families' refusal to consent"". Although this second claim is not based on studies of the Saudi population, it is very plausible. [By the way, a systematic review of bioethics in Saudi Arabia, including 33 studies on organ donation and transplantation, was published very recently and might contain relevant data to support this second claim (Woodman et al. 2022). I encourage the authors to consult this review if they have not already done so.] The article then states that ""to overcome this issue, improvements should be made in documenting potential donors' consent in organ donation registries"".  So far, the rationale seems to be that since the shortage of transplantable organs is partly caused by high rates of family refusal, which is partly caused by unknown individual wishes, then improving the registration of individuals’ wishes may decrease family refusal rates and might, as a consequence, increase organ procurement. So far, so good.  Then, the article introduces opt-in, opt-out and mandatory choice and states that ""This paper aims to analyze the different types of consent systems to address the issue of the high rate of family refusal […]"". There is an argumentative gap here. It is as if changing the consent model is the only possible solution to mitigate the problem of family refusals caused by unknown individual wishes. However, we know there are alternative policies that could be implemented. So, why are the authors focusing on this one alone? Is it supposed to be more effective, or easier to implement, or cheaper than alternative policies?  In other words, among all the policies that could be implemented to try to increase individual registration and decrease family refusals, why is the article focusing only on changing the consent system?  Second, the recommendation to move to a mandatory choice system is not adequately justified.   We will consider the three main reasons to move from opt-in to mandatory choice: effectiveness, ethics, and public support.  Effectiveness  First, the article correctly mentions that the opt-in system is arguably not the most effective (in terms of converting willing donors into actual donors) because, in Saudi Arabia as in several other countries, many individuals do not document their willingness to donate.  Then, the article suggests that the opt-out system is more effective by citing Rithalia and colleagues’ (2009) systematic review of the impact of opt-out. However, the article fail to mention that this study does not necessarily lead to this conclusion. According to Rithalia and colleagues: ""The available evidence suggests that presumed consent is associated with increased organ donation rates, even when other factors are accounted for. However, it cannot be inferred from this that the introduction of presumed consent legislation per se will lead to an increase in organ donation rates."" (Rithalia 2009, p.7)  There are more recent studies and reviews on this topic. Some support the idea that moving from opt-in to opt-out contributes to increasing organ donation rates. Others don’t. At this time, this issue is not settled yet.  Finally, the article mentions that implementing a mandated choice system and using the Tawakkalna app for this could increase the number of registered donors. The article also warns that ""there is sparse evidence on the effectiveness of a mandated choice system in increasing the number of registered donors"". Then, the article mentions a mandated choice policy in Australia that was discontinued because it was not successful.  It is quite obvious that individuals who want to donate their organs are more likely to register their consent in a mandatory choice system than in an opt-in system, because they are required to register their wishes. As a consequence, families are more likely to know the deceased’s wishes. However, individuals who do not want to donate are also more likely to register their refusal in a mandatory choice system than in an opt-in system. Although registered consents will increase, registered refusals will increase too. Therefore, there is no guarantee that moving from opt-in to mandatory choice will lead to increased organ donation rates.   The recommendation of this article works on the paper, but it may not work in the real life. This article does not provide sufficient arguments or evidence to suggest that it might actually work. Arguably, changing legislation should not be a game of trial and error. As said in the abstract: ""more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions of organ donation to ensure feasibility.""   Ethics  The article claims that a mandatory choice system might be the optimal solution in terms of balance between the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of the family in Saudi Arabia. So, why is it better than opt-in and opt-out?  When examining the opt-in system from this perspective, the authors write the following:  ""Some argue that an opt-in system respects personal autonomy since this policy can ensure that the individual's wishes to become a donor is acknowledged (Farsides, 2012; Taylor, 2005). On the other hand, opponents of opt-in policies state that it could undermine autonomy by harvesting organs from unwilling donors who did not document their wishes. (Gill, 2004).""  The second sentence is wrong: under an opt-in system those individuals who did not document their wishes are not considered as potential organ donors, because by definition in order to be considered as a potential donor, they must have opted in. By contrast, it is true that, under an opt-out system, organ can be procured from individuals who didn’t want to donate but failed to express their refusal.  When examining the opt-out system, the authors write the following:   ""A presumed consent system is ethically sound and may not violate autonomy; nevertheless, there are some concerns.""  There is a heated debate in the literature with regard to the ethical acceptability of presumed consent and whether or not it is respectful of individual autonomy. The very idea that someone’s consent could be presumed is problematic. Therefore, I wonder what reasons lead the authors to claim that presumed consent is ethically sound and may not violate autonomy.  The article then mentions that ""the presumption of consent is ’morally no worse than not removing organs from the bodies of people who did want them removed’ (Gill, 2004)"". This sentence confuses two distinct issues. On the one hand, Michael Gill shows that there is presumption on both sides: opt-out presumes willingness to donate, opt-in presumes unwillingness to donate. There is no particular moral issue there. On the other hand, Gill argues that removing organs from the bodies of people who did not want them removed (opt-out) is ""morally no worse than not removing organs from the bodies of people who did want them removed"".  Eventually, the article mentions the following:   ""However, applying a presumed consent policy in the context of Saudi Arabia might be unfeasible due to ethical considerations pertaining to the role of families. In many cases, the family trumps an individuals' autonomy (Al-Shahri, 2002). Therefore, it may be culturally insensitive to implement a presumed consent system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely, which could risk public acceptance.""  There is a leap of argument between the second sentence and the third. The second sentence mentions the fact that the family can overrule the deceased’s wishes (trump an individual’s autonomy). This is actually quite common around the world and not specific to Saudi Arabia (Rosenblum et al. 2012; Delgado et al. 2019). The third sentence mentions that an opt-out system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely could risk public acceptance. Ok, but what about implementing an opt-out system that does not disregard the wishes of the next of kin? These soft opt-out systems are very common worldwide (Rosenblum et al. 2012; Delgado et al. 2019). If the family in Saudi Arabia is allowed to have the last word in the decision-making process under the opt-in system, the family may be allowed to have the last word under an opt-out system too. Besides, the authors’ remark would also apply to a mandated choice system that disregards the wishes of the next of kin completely.  When examining the mandated choice system, the article mentions that ""requiring people to make a choice could undermine autonomy by taking away the right not to choose"" and that ""nevertheless […], it increases a person's likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination"". So, mandated choice encourages self-determination by taking away people’s right not to decide. Whether this is morally better or worse than the opt-in system is debatable.  Public support  Finally, the article mentions that ""a study conducted in Saudi Arabia ranked mandated choice as the most favored consent system"", but warns that ""the study was limited to a single tertiary hospital, and nation-wide studies must be conducted to further validate this finding"".  Summary  To summarise the rationale used in this article to recommend a mandated choice system: (1) It is unclear whether or not a mandated choice system would be more effective in increasing organ donation; (2) It is debatable whether a mandated choice system is morally better than opt-in; and (3) there is some but insufficient evidence to support that people in Saudi Arabia would prefer a mandated choice system better than opt-in, opt-out.  This is not a compelling rationale.   MINOR ISSUES  ""This result was partially due to the opposition to this system's potential to increase the number of donors who opt-out of being a donor."" --> I don't understand this sentence.  ""One of the main obstacles to obtaining family consent in Saudi Arabia is family refusal."" --> I don't know what this sentence is supposed to mean. That ""family refusal is the main obstacle to family consent"" is analytically true.","This is a nicely written paper that argues in favor of using mandated choice to increase the availability of transplant organs in Saudi Arabia. While it does not cover any new ground in its ethical discussion it provides helpful information about the ways in which new technology might be used to enhance organ procurement. However, it suffers from significant empirical and theoretical weaknesses that preclude its indexing as it stands, including inaccurate data, claims that are insufficiently supported by evidence and a poor grounding in philosophical ethics and action theory. I have provided an overview of these issues below.  Issue 1:  “According to a news article, the number of registered donors increased from 20,000 to 200,000, which is a 115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature.”  Three points are worth noting here:  Is there a better source for these figures than a news article? Have the authors examined the original source on which this news article was based? How accurate is this claim?   The increase from 20,000 to 200,000 is not “115%” as the authors claim. This needs to be corrected.   When the authors write “…115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature” do they mean that this 115% increase was immediate after the launch, and then numbers further increased, or do they mean to claim that the increase to 200,000 occurred in the total time after the launch? (The former construal would be compatible with there being an initial increase of 115% and then an greater increase subsequently.)  Issue 2:  “As for ethical considerations, the current opt-in system respects an individual's autonomy. According to Immanuel Kant, undermining a person's autonomy is to treat that person as a mere means to an end without regard for the individual's own goals. Based on Kant's theory, organs from a deceased individual should not be harvested if the person's wish was not to be a donor, even if it intends to save others.”  There are three points that should be made with respect to the claims in this sentence.  The authors should distinguish between personal autonomy and Kantian autonomy. On a theory of personal autonomy a person is autonomous with respect to her desires and actions if they flow from her motivational set in a way that ensures that they originate from her, rather than from elsewhere (where the requirements for what counts as originating from her are spelled out in the theory of personal autonomy that one adopts). On a Kantian account of autonomy a person is autonomous if (roughly) she acts out of respect for the moral law. These are distinct accounts of autonomy, and since the former is often of primary interest in discussions of organ procurement the authors would do well to focus on it rather than its Kantian alternative.   Why couldn’t an opt-out approach to organ procurement also respect a person’s (personal) autonomy? The authors should see here Michael Gill’s “Presumed Consent, Autonomy, and Organ procurement,” Journal of Medicine and Philosophy 29, 1 (2004): 37 – 591.   Merely claiming that Kant would hold that a person’s organs should not be harvested after her death if she did not agree to this is insufficient. The authors need to argue that Kant (or Kantians) are committed to holding that persons have duties to respect the wishes of the dead.   Issue 3:  The authors should note that the differences in the effectiveness of the Austrian and Spanish systems might also be a product of differing infrastructure that is in place to secure available organs, and not merely the result of their different approaches to opt-out systems. The authors also need to provide better sources for their claims here.  Issue 4:  “According to a study conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2018, most participants support organ donation…” - What percentage is captured by “most”?  Issue 5:  “As for ethical considerations, a mandated choice system makes the two choices readily available; it increases a person's likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination.”  Why does requiring persons to make a choice between two alternatives increase her “…likelihood of making an autonomous choice and encourages self-determination”? Indeed, couldn’t requiring that a person choose between two alternatives decrease the degree to which she is autonomous with respect to her relevant choices, insofar as it removes from her the option not to choose — an option which some persons might have preferred? The authors need to do much more to support their claims here, especially since they appear prima facie implausible.","The article first describes the organ donation system in Saudi Arabia and identifies the high rate of family opposition as one major obstacle to increasing cadaveric organ donation rates in the country. Then, the article presents the three main consent policies: opt-in (explicit consent), opt-out (presumed consent), and mandated choice, advocating for the latter one as the best alternative in the context of Saudi Arabia.  Overall, the article is well written and provides a clear and accessible overview of the consent policy alternatives. One interesting point mentioned in the article is the use of the Tawakkalna app as a means of registration of individual preferences about organ donation. However, the article lacks depth in its analysis and suffers from some mistakes and inaccuracies that need to be addressed.  ""Does the paper provide a comprehensive overview of the policy and the context of its implementation in a way which is accessible to a general reader?""   Only partly. The overview is accessible to a general reader but it is not comprehensive and it lacks depth in its analysis. Also, its main hypothesis is based on insufficient evidence.  For instance, after mentioning that only 33% of approached families authorised in 2019 the retrieval of organs from their loved ones, the article claims that the relatives’ lack of knowledge of the deceased’s wishes as one of the main reasons for the families’ refusal. [By the way, the wording of the sentence beginning ""Lack of knowledge of the potential donor…"" should be revised.] This second claim is based on Palmer 2012. Although this reference appears to be a good review of the literature, it has not been peer-reviewed. In addition, it is also relatively outdated (meaning that other reviews have been conducted more recently) and the studies reviewed were conducted mostly in English speaking Western countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, which means that their conclusions may not necessarily be extensible to other cultural contexts such as Saudi Arabia. In other words, although it may be true that lack of knowledge by the family is, in these countries, one of the main reasons for their refusal, there is no guarantee that the same conclusion holds in other countries, especially when these countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia) have a different social organization, religion, and cultural background.  Since the argument of the article is based on the claim that family refusals are mainly caused by the family’s lack of knowledge of the potential donor wishes (which could be addressed, according to the authors, by a mandated choice policy), stronger evidence is needed to support this claim, especially in the context of Saudi Arabia. In other words, authors should provide more updated and compelling evidence that this claim is true—or, at the very least, that it may be true in their country—before proposing a policy to address it.   There is a rich and vast literature of empirical studies on the factors of family decision-making and willingness/refusal to donate that are contemporary or posterior to Palmer 2012. Here are some peer-reviewed literature reviews I am aware of, including some systematic reviews:  Kentish-Barnes N, Siminoff LA, Walker W, Urbanski M, Charpentier J, Thuong M, et al.

Progress in Transplantation 2013;23:99–104.14  After mentioning the lack of evidence as ""one of the main reasons for the families’ refusal to consent"", the authors write: ""To overcome this issue, improvements should be made in documenting potential donors’ consent in organ donation registries."" This conclusion does not necessarily follow or only partially. There are several other means to address family refusal rates, on the one hand, and the lack of knowledge issue, on the other. These means include mass media campaigns, targeted educational campaigns, the presence of a Specialist Nurse for Organ Donation (SNOD) as it is done in the UK, extensive training of transplant coordinators for the family interview as it is done in Spain, financial incentives to donation, prioritization programmes as it is done in Israel, etc. Some countries (e.g. Germany) with much lower family refusal rates than Saudi Arabia, do not have an organ donation registry but only an organ donor card. Other countries (e.g. Spain) with very low family refusal rates, do not have any registry at all (except for living wills that are barely used in practice for registering organ donation preferences) nor any official organ donor card. Fostering communication about organ donation among relatives and training the medical staff to conduct the family interview are alternative ways to increase family knowledge without requiring the registration or documentation of individual preferences.  In the next paragraph, the article says: ""There are three known methods of consent when registering to become a donor upon death: informed consent (opt-in system), mandated choice and presumed consent (opt-out system)."" This wording is confusing. First, the opt-in system is not based on informed consent but only on explicit or expressed consent. Second, although the opt-out system is compatible with a registry of refusals, presumed consent only applies when no registering has taken place. Third, it is important to differentiate the models of individual consent (informed, presumed) and consent policies (opt-in, opt-out, mandated choice) from the means available to individuals to express their consent or refusal to donate. Some countries have registries, others don’t, regardless of their consent policy.  The article then states its main objective: ""This paper aims to analyze the different types of consent systems to address the issue of the high rate of family refusal. The study offers some important insights that will aid decision-makers in selecting an alternative that is more likely to reduce the shortage of organs.""  This objective presupposes that there is a causal relationship between the consent systems and the rates of family refusal. I would recommend the authors provide references or data to support such an assumption. I ignore whether this is the case or not and whether there is at least a correlation between the two. I am really curious about it. By looking at the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation’s Newsletter Transplant 2017, which provides data on family refusal in many countries throughout the world, I fail prima facie to see any trend that may be related to the consent systems in place.  With regard to the article’s proposal of a mandated choice policy, it is true that if registering a preference in favour or against organ donation was mandatory in the country, this would likely increase the registration rates and decrease the families’ lack of knowledge about their loved one’s wishes. As a consequence, the number of family refusals caused by this lack of knowledge would also likely decrease. Question is: first, is this the best way to increase organ donation rates and, second, how many family refusals are actually caused by lack of knowledge in Saudi Arabia?  To answer these questions, it would be good to give some perspective. According to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, Saudi Arabia had a deceased organ donation rate of 3.3 pmp in 2019 and 1.9 pmp in 2020, which is relatively low although not in the lower end of the ranking. In 2017, according to the same source, Saudi Arabia had a population of 32.2 M and a total of 92 deceased donors, that is, a rate of 2.9 donors pmp; 333 family interviews were conducted asking for authorisation, out of which 230 (69%) refused. The article mentions that, according to a 2009 study of Saudi University students, ""about 70% of participants are willing to become donors"". If this figure was representative of the general population, if all individuals had registered their wishes, if all families of those willing to donate authorised organ procurement, and if all potential donors were eventually converted into actual donors, the total number of donors in 2017 would have been 92 + (333 x 70%) = 325, increasing the donors rate to 10% which is much better (comparable to that of Germany that same year). [Another study (Alnasyan et al. 2019) also cited in the article but whose figures on willingness to donate are not mentioned by the article says that 77.7% of the general public expressed a willingness to donate, although 29.1% were willing to donate only to their relatives]  The problem is that we don’t know how likely is such a scenario. There are no data provided in the article regarding how many of the family refusals were caused by lack of knowledge or by other reasons such as those cited in Palmer 2012: Not wishing for surgery to the body/having concerns regarding disfigurement; Feelings that the patient had suffered enough; Disagreements among the family group; Religious/cultural reasons; Dissatisfaction with healthcare staff and process; Concerns over delay to funeral/burial process; Unable to accept death, or lack of understanding of brain death; Concerns regarding the integrity of process e.g. unfair organ allocation of organs and organ selling; Relatives deciding themselves that organs would not be suitable; Longstanding negative views on organ donation; Relatives were emotionally exhausted.  Actually, the article itself mentions that some unknown proportion of the family refusals may not be caused by lack of knowledge: ""It is important to note that, under the current policy, families still have the right to veto that decision despite their loved one’s consent to become a donor."" Also: ""In many cases, the family trumps an individual’s autonomy (Al-Shahri, 2002)"" The reference here cited (Al-Shahri, 2002) says ""In Saudi culture, the authority of the family overrules the individuals’ autonomy. Decisions taken by patients can often be altered according to the views of the family"". I am thus curious to know the proportion of families who veto the deceased’s consent as well as their reasons to do so, because this is not caused by lack of knowledge of the deceased’s wishes, and some of the families who do lack knowledge may share the same reasons to refuse as those who don’t.  Is the discussion on the implications clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?  The discussion on the implications is quite clear but it lacks accuracy and it does not cite enough updated and relevant literature.  For example, the authors mention that ""According to a news article, the number of registered donors increased from 20,000 to 200,000, which is a 115% increase after the launch of the donor registration feature"". This is a ten-fold increase and definitely not a 115% increase. Something is wrong. I checked (using an automated translator) the news article cited here and it seems that these figures are actually mentioned. I failed to see any sources cited in the news article. This tells me that this news article is not reliable and thus it is not worth citing in a scientific article. Anyway, even if the 20,000 to 200,000 increase in registrations was true, compared to more than 34 M inhabitants in 2021, this represents only 0.6% of the total population. This is much better, but still anecdotal.  Another example. The article claims that ""after adopting a hard opt-out policy in Austria, the rate of donations quadrupled within eight years (Zink et al., 2005). On the other hand, a soft approach to the policy did not impact donation rates in Spain, which indicates that a hard opt-out policy could be more effective."" There are several problems here. First, the reference cited with regard to Austria does not provide any evidence for the claim but cites two other sources, one of which15 makes this claim without any evidence or references provided. This claim may be true or it may not, but the reference cited here is not sufficient to support the claim. Second, with regard to Spain, the policy is soft in clinical practice but hard according to the law. Third, what did impact donation rates in Spain was not the implementation of an opt-out policy in 1979, but the creation of the National Transplant Organisation (ONT) in 1989. Fourth, it is odd to claim that a hard opt-out policy (such as in Austria) could be more effective than a soft opt-out policy (such as in Spain) considering that Spain has a much higher donation rate (49.6 pmp in 2019) than Austria (23.4 pmp in 2019) according to the GODT. Fifth, several studies, including systematic reviews, have explored the impact of presumed consent policies. They should be cited.  One more example. The article mentions ""a study in the Netherlands, a country that adopted a mandated choice, concluded that this system generated more registered donors than both informed and presumed consent systems (Van Dalen & Henkens, 2014)."" First, the Netherlands had not adopted a mandated choice policy but an opt-in system (as the authors of the cited study clearly state in their article). Second, the Netherlands have recently implemented an opt-out system. Third, the cited study does not assess the actual performance of a mandated choice system in the country but compares, in an experimental setting using counterfactuals, whether people would register as donors (hypothetically) if they moved to a region with presumed consent, explicit consent, or mandated choice. Fourth, the results from this study show that people would be more willing to register as donors under a mandated choice system (66%), but this result is only 4 points higher than presumed consent (62%) and many more people would also refuse to donate under a mandated choice system (34%) than under a presumed consent system (18%). In other words, mandated choice would increase donors by 4% and non-donors by 16% when compared to presumed consent.  Are the recommendations made clear, balanced, and justified on the basis of the presented arguments?  The first recommendation is changing the method of obtaining consent from opt-in to mandated choice. Considering the comments above, it is not sufficiently justified. The authors may want to look at a similar recommendation made in other countries, such as a law proposal (unsuccessful) made by members of the German Parliament (see http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/110/1911087.pdf, text in German), as well as the report on organ donation by the Swiss National Human Medical Ethics Commission (see https://www.nek-cne.admin.ch/inhalte/Themen/Stellungnahmen/fr/NEK-Stellungnahme_Organspende_FR.pdf, text in French).  The second recommendation refers to modifying the Tawakkalna App. The proposed modifications may be useful, provided that more people register their organ donation preferences in the app.   The third recommendation or part of it is sensible: ""more research dedicated to assessing the feasibility of implementing a new consent system"", as well as ""understanding the current Saudi context"" to predict [I would say, estimate] its success.",,
Attitudes toward and knowledge of collaboration of dental and medical practice among medical students in Southern India: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey,0.0,"I have no further comments The authors have tried to address some of the points I raised during the previous review.   The points still unclear to me are the pretesting of the questionnaire and the percentage of students from each college who participated in the study.

Cut-off points for low skeletal muscle mass in older adults: Colombia versus other populations,0.5,"The objective of this article is to define cut-off points for LMM (low muscle mass) using SMI (skeletal muscle mass index) evaluated by BIA (bioimpedance) for Colombian older adults, which can be used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. It is pertinent since the importance of having specific cut-off points for each region is recognized, in addition to the fact that there are few published studies on SMM (Whole-body skeletal muscle mass) or ASMM (appendicular skeletal muscle mass) cut-off points. The importance of having specific cut-off points for each region to define LMM is recognized.  Observations:  Introduction:  It is suggested to mention the difference between obtaining Whole-body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and not ASMM to define LMM, as mentioned in EWGSOP2. I don't know if in this analysis the ASMM could have been better calculated, this formula could have been used for its estimation that is mentioned in the EWGSOP2 (Yamada et al., 20171).   Methodology:  In relation to the previous comment, the MesH term ""appendicular skeletal muscle mass"" could have been added to the systematic review.   Statistic analysis:  It is mentioned that the proportion of subjects with LMM in the present study was compared with the results reported in the studies included in the review, but it is not mentioned what statistical tests were used for this comparison.   Results:  It is recommended to add a table of the general characteristics of the study population, such as means and frequencies of variables such as age, sex, comorbidity, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, BMI), SMI, among others. It is mentioned that there were significant differences between the proportion of subjects with LMM in the present study versus studies reported in the review, it is suggested to add the p value or the 95% CI found in the statistical tests.   Discussion:  To go deeper into using SMM and not ASMM to define LMM, as well as about the model used Hydra 4200 Xitron Technologies bioimpedancemeter®, which has previously been reported on the accuracy of this equipment.  This is a prospective study aiming to define local cut-off points for low muscle mass and to compare them with the existing cut-off points in the literature. A “one size fits all” approach can be misleading in the diagnosis of sarcopenia. EWGSOP has therefore recommended that national cut-off points be used for sarcopenia diagnosis. This study fills a gap in the definition of sarcopenia and is of interest to the readership of the journal. However, some major and minor points need to be clarified.   Major point: For sarcopenia diagnosis, EWGSOP recommends using the normative data of healthy young adults. Why have the authors used the normative data of older adults for LMM diagnosis?   Minor points: “237 elderly patients from the city of Manizales who live in the community were included in the study. The patients were evaluated in the University of Caldas health service provider.” It is not quite clear how the patients were recruited. Were they hospital outpatients? If so, they are expected to be relatively more disabled compared to the older population in general, which may be considered as a limitation of the study.   The abbreviations under table 1 reads:  -2DE: below two standard deviations, which should have been “-2SD” (also in the table: “-2DE of Turkish young adults”).   It would be better if the discussion started with “To the authors’ best knowledge…”   There are minor grammatical and semantic errors throughout the text.  “The implication in the clinical practice is that the use of our cut-off points from a young population in closer to real data form elders and prevents underestimation or overestimation of the prevalence of LLM or sarcopenia in older adults as if it could happen if, for example, the cut-off points reported by Bahat et al.8 (male: 9.20; female: 7.40) were used for our population, or, even more serious, if the references by a Masanes et al.12 (male: 8.25; female: 6.68), or Björkman et al.14 (male: 9.31; female: 6.90) were applied.” This sentence in the discussion section is too long and confusing.   In order to avoid ageism, the term “elderly” should be replaced with “older adults”.","The objective of this article is to define cut-off points for LMM (low muscle mass) using SMI (skeletal muscle mass index) evaluated by BIA (bioimpedance) for Colombian older adults, which can be used for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.

""Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a malignant disease of the urothelial cell lining the upper urinary tract from renal calyces, pelvises, and ureter down to ureteral orifice.""

Patient perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after total hip arthroplasty: A qualitative study (PHETHAS-2),0.4,"This is a well-conducted and good study write-up, which is reported transparently and balanced in its conclusions. The qualitative approach is well chosen and allows the patient's perspective to be described. The authors have responded well to previous reviewers' recommendations, and these changes have improved the article.   We have a couple of minor points for the authors to consider.  For clarity, please could the authors list the four sub-themes in the second line of the results section after they state there are four sub-themes.    The findings regarding pain (presence and absence) and its relation to performing exercises are particularly interesting and highlighted in the abstract's conclusion. This is a novel angle and a perspective that has come from the patient's perspective, however, we feel that this finding could be explored and considered in more detail in the discussion section.   Thank you for the revisions to this very interesting manuscript on a timely and meaningful topic. I have no further comments. Thank you for the opportunity to review this revision. The authors have thoughtfully reflected on and addressed previous comments. This already interesting manuscript is much richer and clearer now.  Of note, the abstract (specifically the results) was not updated in this revision, and the number of themes/subthemes in the abstract is not consistent with the text.  The findings are much stronger. But - visually - it is unclear how the themes and subthemes are broken up. The formatting makes it appear that there are two primary themes while the authors state there is one theme and four subthemes.  Linkage of the barriers/facilitators in Table 2 to the new subthemes could also be clearer. Reframing the first paragraph of the Results section may help, e.g.: “The analysis of the data resulted in the identification of one main theme, ‘wishing to return to the habitual everyday life’, which is expanded on below, including four subthemes. Barriers and facilitators to performing the home-based rehabilitation exercise program were identified throughout the theme and subthemes and are summarized in Table 2.” Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. This is a qualitative study exploring patients’ perspectives of unsupervised home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after a total hip arthroplasty. The sample includes patients enrolled in a pragmatic cohort study of unsupervised home-based exercise and patients not enrolled in the cohort study. All qualitative participants received the same exercise instructions and were interviewed at 10 weeks post-surgery. The data were synthesized into one main theme and a subtheme.  Overall, this is a very interesting paper on a timely topic, and the methods are detailed and transparent. The findings have implications for clinical practice to support patients’ recovery after total hip arthroplasty. The study is strengthened by use of a theoretical concept and inclusion of participants external to the cohort study. Figure 1 is an excellent diagram that helps the reader understand the flow of the study procedures. The discussion has been significantly enhanced in this version of the manuscript. Additionally, the authors engage in thoughtful reflection on whether adherence to rehabilitation exercise is necessary if people have returned to everyday life. Degree of data availability is appropriate given the study design.  I have a few questions and suggestions to further improve the clarity of reporting and richness of the findings.  Introduction  Additional specificity in the study aim is suggested to clarify that “home-based rehabilitation exercise” refers to an unsupervised program. Otherwise, in certain contexts, this label could be misinterpreted as supervised rehabilitation performed in a home setting versus an outpatient clinic.   The last sentence in the 3rd paragraph may benefit from explicit mention of facilitators and barriers to improve the link between patient perspectives of rehabilitation exercise and the authors’ discussion of adherence.   The motivation to study patient perspectives of general physical activity, in addition to rehabilitation exercise, should be more clearly specified in the introduction, (particularly given the embedding of the interview study within a cohort study of rehabilitation exercise).  Methods  The definition of “home-based rehabilitation exercise” should perhaps also define “home-based.” Alternatively, the sentence could read, “We defined rehabilitation exercise as a plan of physical activities…”.   The authors have not fully addressed the previous reviewer’s comments about sampling. The authors confirm in their response that the size was not determined a priori, but how did they determine when to stop interviewing? Was any form of saturation used? Additionally, the modified sentence about purposeful sampling based on the ongoing analysis is unclear. Were specific participants recruited to fill gaps in knowledge (e.g., someone who was very adherent was purposefully selected because of emerging findings related to nonadherence)? Or is this statement actually meant to reflect decisions about how many participants to recruit versus who to recruit (i.e., sample size versus purposeful sampling)?   Did the standard care participants also have an exercise diary? It is included in the interview guide but only specified in Figure 1 for the PHETHAS-1 participants. If this was only for the PHETHAS-1 participants, could this have influenced the findings in any way, including the increased adherence noted in the cohort subsample?   Why was the time frame of 10 weeks post-op chosen for the interview? Was this related to how long patients were supposed to perform the home-based program?   Do AG, JG, or CR have any experience with rehabilitation? If so, that should be noted in addition to their research experience. If not, whether this is a limitation should be considered.   The data analysis section would be strengthened by additional detail about how the investigators moved from codes to themes.  Results  I have the same comment as the first reviewer regarding the findings. I appreciate the authors’ response that this synthesis best reflected the participants’ experiences in relation to the theoretical concept of “conduct of everyday life.” However, one theme with one subtheme may suggest a relatively shallow analysis given the amount of data collected and the inclusion of inductive coding. Specifically, additional subthemes may have enhanced the clarity and richness of the findings. Currently, a lot of information is distilled into the single main theme, which also limits the cohesion of the findings. For example, some of the specific barriers and facilitators to exercise performance do not directly align with the motivation of returning to everyday life and may have been better synthesized in a subtheme.   Regarding the label for the main theme, the meaning of “well-known” is unclear and is not evident in the description of the theme.   In Table 2, the language of “reaching goal of returning to everyday life” may imply that having achieved the goal is the facilitator. I believe the authors actually mean that the “goal of returning to everyday life” is the facilitator.   In Table 2, what is meant by the obligation to the associated physiotherapist? Wouldn’t this be relevant also for the non-cohort participants as a physio instructed them in their exercises? Is this more specifically obligation to the researcher?   I find it surprising that participants expressed no barriers toward general physical activities. Wouldn’t the presence of pain, for example, impede? Were there perhaps fewer barriers expressed versus no barriers? Or could this be an artifact related to the interview guide, which focused predominantly on rehabilitation exercise?   The information about different perspectives in PHETHAS-1 versus standard care participants does not clearly align with the subtheme and may fit better in the main theme. Additionally, regarding the comment that PHETHAS-1 participants shared that the exercises would benefit them personally, the implications are unclear. Are the authors saying that PHETHAS-1 participants perceived more benefit from the exercises because the exercises were situated in a research context?  Discussion  In the perspectives section, a citation to the protocol paper should be included by “we have described in detail what this particular rehabilitation consisted of” as most of the detail is not in the current paper.  Conclusion  The conclusion repeats the detailed findings but would be strengthened by including a general take-home message for the reader.  This article addresses patients’ perspectives on home-based rehabilitation exercises following total hip arthroplasty (THA). The topic is investigated through a qualitative method using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The study found the theme: 'wishing to return to the well-known everyday life', and the subtheme 'general physical activity versus rehabilitation exercise'. The topic of the paper is interesting and overall the paper is well-written; however, there are a number of issues throughout the paper.  Introduction:  The Introduction is a well-written section uncovering the knowledge within THA and home-based rehabilitation exercise.   Aim:  There are some concerns about the aim as it could reflect the title in a better way. The semi-structured interview guide sets the stage for broader and more open interviews with the patients’ perspectives on the topic in general, including facilitators and barriers. Rewording is wanted for the aim so that it better reflects the title which has a more open approach. A suggestion could be something like this: 'the study aimed to investigate how patients perceived home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after THA, including facilitators and barriers'.   Methods:  The theoretical underpinning with the use of the concept 'conduct of everyday life' fits the topic very well, and the definition of home-based rehabilitation exercise is helpful for the overall understanding of the paper.   The study investigates home-based rehabilitation exercises, for international readers, it is crucial to understand what it contains in Denmark and Silkeborg. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed description of home-based rehabilitation exercises.   Furthermore, was it the same programme for the two included groups? The authors have reference number 10 to describe the home-based rehabilitation exercise, this is a review, which confuses me. Please elaborate on the details of the programmes and whether they were similar for the two groups.  Regarding the patients and recruitment, please elaborate on some of the details:  Sample size – how was that determined?   How many were asked to participate in the study?   Did any refuse to participate?   Included participants from the PHETHAS-1 study were 14 – how many were included in the PHETHAS-1 study, as this might be the group of patients where the participants in the PHETHAS-2 study were selected?   Results:  Taking into account that the interviews lasted an average of 43 minutes and the open questions in the semi-structured interview guide, it is surprising that only one theme, including one under-theme, was generated. There must be huge data material from all these minutes of interviews. During the analysis process, could it be possible to find more valuable results to give more perspectives on the aim?   Quote P12: “Because first of all…"" – Could another interpretation be more like a desire for a contact to the healthcare system because of uncertainty?   To build upon what is already known, it could be interesting if there were any quotes about the last question in the interview guide: We are considering investigating whether this exercise program works better than general physical activities, what do you think of this idea?    Discussion:  The Discussion section is very short. Further discussion about the meaning of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic factors could be valuable for the paper.   The concept 'conduct of everyday life' was chosen as a theoretical framework, it would have been interesting to bring this framework into the discussion. Additionally, topics such as pain and absence of pain and individual expectations alignment could be further discussed.   To improve the Discussion section, more research and other theories on, for example, the above-mentioned topics could expand on the results and make implications for practice more clear.   Patients from the two groups were interviewed in different places (at the hospital and in their homes), what impact could that have on the results? In addition, patients being a part of another study, what consequences does that have for the transferability of the study?   Two paragraphs in the Discussion section belong more to the Conclusion or a perspective section: “Overall the participants …” and “There may be additional …”.   Conclusion:  The conclusion is supported by the results. However, adding a perspective section would be helpful to clarify how the findings can improve clinical practice."" ","This is a well-conducted and good study write-up, which is reported transparently and balanced in its conclusions. The qualitative approach is well chosen and allows the patient's perspective to be described. The authors have responded well to previous reviewers' recommendations, and these changes have improved the article.   We have a couple of minor points for the authors to consider.  For clarity, please could the authors list the four sub-themes in the second line of the results section after they state there are four sub-themes.    The findings regarding pain (presence and absence) and its relation to performing exercises are particularly interesting and highlighted in the abstract's conclusion. This is a novel angle and a perspective that has come from the patient's perspective, however, we feel that this finding could be explored and considered in more detail in the discussion section.  ",Thank you for the revisions to this very interesting manuscript on a timely and meaningful topic. I have no further comments.,"Thank you for the opportunity to review this revision. The authors have thoughtfully reflected on and addressed previous comments. This already interesting manuscript is much richer and clearer now.  Of note, the abstract (specifically the results) was not updated in this revision, and the number of themes/subthemes in the abstract is not consistent with the text.  The findings are much stronger. But - visually - it is unclear how the themes and subthemes are broken up. The formatting makes it appear that there are two primary themes while the authors state there is one theme and four subthemes.  Linkage of the barriers/facilitators in Table 2 to the new subthemes could also be clearer. Reframing the first paragraph of the Results section may help, e.g.: “The analysis of the data resulted in the identification of one main theme, ‘wishing to return to the habitual everyday life’, which is expanded on below, including four subthemes. Barriers and facilitators to performing the home-based rehabilitation exercise program were identified throughout the theme and subthemes and are summarized in Table 2.”","Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. This is a qualitative study exploring patients’ perspectives of unsupervised home-based rehabilitation exercise and general physical activity after a total hip arthroplasty. The sample includes patients enrolled in a pragmatic cohort study of unsupervised home-based exercise and patients not enrolled in the cohort study. All qualitative participants received the same exercise instructions and were interviewed at 10 weeks post-surgery. The data were synthesized into one main theme and a subtheme.  Overall, this is a very interesting paper on a timely topic, and the methods are detailed and transparent. The findings have implications for clinical practice to support patients’ recovery after total hip arthroplasty. The study is strengthened by use of a theoretical concept and inclusion of participants external to the cohort study. Figure 1 is an excellent diagram that helps the reader understand the flow of the study procedures. The discussion has been significantly enhanced in this version of the manuscript. Additionally, the authors engage in thoughtful reflection on whether adherence to rehabilitation exercise is necessary if people have returned to everyday life. Degree of data availability is appropriate given the study design.  I have a few questions and suggestions to further improve the clarity of reporting and richness of the findings.  Introduction  Additional specificity in the study aim is suggested to clarify that “home-based rehabilitation exercise” refers to an unsupervised program. Otherwise, in certain contexts, this label could be misinterpreted as supervised rehabilitation performed in a home setting versus an outpatient clinic.   The last sentence in the 3rd paragraph may benefit from explicit mention of facilitators and barriers to improve the link between patient perspectives of rehabilitation exercise and the authors’ discussion of adherence.   The motivation to study patient perspectives of general physical activity, in addition to rehabilitation exercise, should be more clearly specified in the introduction, (particularly given the embedding of the interview study within a cohort study of rehabilitation exercise).  Methods  The definition of “home-based rehabilitation exercise” should perhaps also define “home-based.” Alternatively, the sentence could read, “We defined rehabilitation exercise as a plan of physical activities…”.   The authors have not fully addressed the previous reviewer’s comments about sampling. The authors confirm in their response that the size was not determined a priori, but how did they determine when to stop interviewing? Was any form of saturation used? Additionally, the modified sentence about purposeful sampling based on the ongoing analysis is unclear. Were specific participants recruited to fill gaps in knowledge (e.g., someone who was very adherent was purposefully selected because of emerging findings related to nonadherence)? Or is this statement actually meant to reflect decisions about how many participants to recruit versus who to recruit (i.e., sample size versus purposeful sampling)?   Did the standard care participants also have an exercise diary? It is included in the interview guide but only specified in Figure 1 for the PHETHAS-1 participants. If this was only for the PHETHAS-1 participants, could this have influenced the findings in any way, including the increased adherence noted in the cohort subsample?   Why was the time frame of 10 weeks post-op chosen for the interview? Was this related to how long patients were supposed to perform the home-based program?   Do AG, JG, or CR have any experience with rehabilitation? If so, that should be noted in addition to their research experience. If not, whether this is a limitation should be considered.   The data analysis section would be strengthened by additional detail about how the investigators moved from codes to themes.

"The identification of high-performing antibodies for RNA-binding protein FUS for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence",0.6666666666666666,"Thank you for considering my comments and suggestions on your manuscript. I am pleased to say that the majority of the concerns I raised have been adequately addressed.  I have only a minor suggestion.  Introduction (P3, L7 ‘familial ALS/FTD’): Let me write again, as my writing does not seem to be coming across well. If literature reference 9 (Van Langenhove et al., 20101) includes “familial” ALS/FTD with a ‘family history’, please disregard it. However, if reference 9 pertains to “sporadic” ALS/FTD without a family history, please include references such as ""Frameshift and novel mutations in FUS in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ALS/dementia."" as literature on “familial” ALS/FTD.   Thank you once again for your diligent cooperation throughout this process. I truly appreciate your responsiveness and your commitment to addressing the comments and suggestions. In their manuscript „The identification of high-performing antibodies for RNA-binding protein FUS for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence”, Alshalfie and coauthors perform a thorough comparison of commercial antibodies against FUS, a protein that has gained a lot of interest in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and also in general molecular cell biology. Since many antibodies do not perform as good as they are advertised, such a comparison is highly welcome. The approach (also using knockout cell lines as control) is solid and the results are clear and very well documented. I only have one suggestion: in Table 2, the authors should include one or several column(s) (next to “vendors recommended application”) with comments reflecting the results of the study (e.g. ab243880 seems to work well in WB, in IP and in IF). Dear Laflamme C and co-authors,  Thank you for allowing me to review your manuscript titled ""The identification of high-performing antibodies for RNA binding protein FUS for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence."" Your study investigates the utility of commercially available antibodies targeting FUS, one of the causative genes of ALS, through WB, IP, and IF techniques. The experimental findings presented by the authors are expected to be valuable and beneficial for FUS researchers. While the overall methodology and results are sound, I propose minor revisions.  1. Introduction (P3, L6-): Unlike ALS, FTD with the FUS gene mutation is rare. Does the attached literature include cases of familial FTLD? If not, I recommend adding relevant references or modifying the text accordingly.  2. Figure 3 (P5): The mosaic arrangement of WT and KO cells in the image is clear and visually appealing. However, the image coverage appears to be somewhat limited. I suggest expanding the image coverage or adding additional images to enhance the readers' understanding.   I hope these suggestions are helpful in improving the quality and impact of your manuscript.

"Clinical equivalence of Trusynth fast® and Vicryl rapide® polyglactin 910 fast absorbing sutures on maternal morbidity experienced by women following episiotomy repair: a single-blind, randomized study",0.75,"No further comments to make. Article is approved. The article is scientifically valid in its current form. Brief description of the article: This article aims at describing the type of suture material that can be used to repair the episiotomy. Benefits and complications of using Trusynth Fast and Vicryl Rapide polygactin 910 fast absorbing sutures. Primary outcome analysed was subjective post episiotomy perineal pain with the type of suture material used. Secondary outcomes analysed were quantity of local anesthesia, number of sutures used, time to repair episiotomy, intraoperative suture handling, analgesics used, early and late wound complications, wound re-suturing, time to complete healing, presence of residual sutures, return to sexual activity and dyspareunia. They concluded that Trusynth Fast® suture is clinically equivalent to Vicryl Rapide® suture and can be used for episiotomy repair with minimal risk of perineal pain and wound complications.  Relevance: Studying the type of suture material used for episiotomy and assessing the complications and side effects will help the clinicians in deciding the type of suture material to be used for episiotomy.

What part of the plant were the leaves taken from? Were they photosynthetically mature leaves? The results are relatively well described. The discussion is rather descriptive.,"All comments were done in the text, and the art is confirmed for indexing in the journal.","This research investigated effect of Fara-darmani Consciousness Field on alleviation of salt stress. It has some interests for the readers and me. Fara-darmani Consciousness Field increased antioxidant systems in plants against stress. But There are some questions about this art, and need to answer by authors:  Why did the authors select just 0 and 150 mM Nacl for this research?  The intensity or wavelength are not clear, and isn’t the device regulates for intensity or wave?  How Fara-darmani Consciousness Field affect the cell, how is perceived by the cell, what is the effect on organisms? The discussion needs to improve.  If there isn’t any research about Fara-darmani Consciousness Field, the author can use some article for the discussion:    Impact of the Static Magnetic Field on Growth, Pigments, Osmolytes, Nitric Oxide, Hydrogen Sulfide Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase Activity, Antioxidant Defense System, and Yield in Lettuce.1   Establishment and assessment of cell suspension cultures of Matricaria chamomilla as a possible source of apigenin under static magnetic field.2 ",
Effect of intraoperative PEEP with recruitment maneuvers on the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications during general anesthesia––protocol for Bayesian analysis of three randomized clinical trials of intraoperative ventilation,1.0,"I thank the Authors for their response and recommend to accept the manuscript in its present form.  Best regards Lukas Gasteiger The authors present a comprehensive protocol for a reanalysis of three RCTs using Bayesian meta-analysis techniques. While the three individual studies had slightly different scopes, the common primary outcome of all is the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), and the exposure is a different ventilation strategy (“long protective” vs “non-lung protective”; high PEEP + recruitment maneuvers vs. low PEEP and no RMs).   The authors argue that a recent meta-analysis using classical frequentist methodology (mixed effects logistic regression) yielded “no difference” between the exposure levels (n=1,913 “lung protective” vs. 1,924 “non-lung protective”, raw complication incidence 29.4% vs 32.2% (OR 0.87 (0.75-1.01)), but some differences in secondary endpoints (more frequent desaturations in low PEEP, more intraoperative hypotension in high PEEP, …). The point that Bayesian methodology, providing a more tangible and interpretable effect size for the interventions’ efficacy, would be a suitable analytic approach here, is well taken and there are prominent examples in the literature where a Bayesian re-analysis served to further the understanding of (particularly composite) datasets.   Thank you for the opportunity to review your work. The protocol is very well written and the research question is valid, relevant, and succinctly presented.   My two primary concerns lie (1) in the definition of PCCs, and (2) in the explanation text on how the effect estimate priors will be weighted.   The PCC definition arguably differs between the three studies. E.g., the pulmonary infection category which is looser in PROVHILO than in the other studies, or bronchospasm, which is looser in PROBESE. The authors duly note the existence of these differences in their limitations section. As they argue, using a wide outcome definition may be sensible, given a relatively broad exposure bandwidth and heterogeneity in practical application of the treatment arms. The reviewer wonders if the authors deliberated adding different complication stages in the analysis or expanding their sensitivity analysis in this regard (they were already planning on excluding “minor” complications for sensitivity analysis). On the other hand, subgrouping may limit statistical power further and lead to model convergence issues.   As for the prior definition; This important topic is explained at length and is planned according to a comprehensive protocol (Zampieri et al, 2021) and technical description (Röver et al, 2021). The reviewer appreciates the nuanced approach. However, I do believe that some more information / explanation could be conveyed regarding the choice of relative prior weighting.   Specific comments:  Please add a reference to the published results of the frequentist meta-analysis (Campos et al, BJA 2022 1); only the study protocol is referenced.   The authors will use a half-normal distribution for the heterogeneity prior. Could they briefly explain the rationale to perform a sensitivity analysis with I squared distribution (instead of i.e. Half-Cauchy).   “Previous studies suggested a benefit of PEEP and RM, but many studies were neutral or indeterminate when using a frequentist approach. Therefore, we will consider a moderate belief strength for both the optimistic and neutral prior and a weak pessimistic prior. Following previous recommendations,7 we will define priors as follows….”   What exactly does the word “therefore” signify here? It seems sensible to align the means ESs to the preexisting data, the weighting choice for the optimistic vs pessimistic priors could be explained some more (especially with regard to possible pessimistic assumptions, i.e., higher complication incidence). I suggest the authors elaborate a bit more here.  This is a very well designed protocol for a Bayesian analysis of three recent RCT's to better understand the effect of intraoperative PEEP on PPCs. By now no RCT was able to clearly show a benefit of a higher PEEP and RM compared to lower PEEP levels and no RM. Therefore the question, if such an intervention is beneficial to our patients, is of high clinical relevance.  The chosen model to use a Bayesian protocol seems appropriate and adds the advantage that no new trial and inclusion of patients is needed.  Furthermore to assess the effect of this intervention is of central interest as it is known, that a higher lever of PEEP may also interact with Right Ventricular Function and therefore may lead to circulatory side-effects such as hypotension. Also, an increased need for vasopressor therapy may be associated.   Is it planned to also assess for circulatory side-effects as secondary outcome?  The authors submitted the protocol for a Bayesian analysis of a dataset composed by data from three major RCTc of intraoperative ventilation evaluating high PEEP + recruitment maneuvers vs low PEEP and no recruitment maneuvers. The dataset (REPEAT) has been already used for frequentist analysis and is of high internal and external validity. The authors are expert in the field and are able to provide important insights with this analysis. The methods for this Bayesian analysis, especially the selected prior distributions are reasonable and adequate.  I fully support the indexing of this protocol and look forward to seeing the results of the analysis.",I thank the Authors for their response and recommend to accept the manuscript in its present form.

The COVID-19 third wave in Myanmar following the military coup,0.3333333333333333,"The authors have successfully revised the paper, that has significantly improved. Nice work  In the introduction, second paragraph, I think it would very useful for the reader if the authors added and presented some socio-economic factors that affected the COVID-19 health implications. Several scholars have written about this. Illustrative studies that the authors could include are:   Kapitsinis, N. (2021) The underlying factors of excess mortality in 2020: a cross-country analysis of pre-pandemic healthcare conditions and strategies to cope with Covid-19.

Country-level determinants of the severity of the first global wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: an ecological study. BMJ Open. 2021;11:e0420342.  In the methods, the authors should explain more clearly and detailed how they distributed the online questionnaire, e.g. which online outlets they used. This will offer a more clear picture of methodology adopted.   Moreover, the authors could present and describe whether the questionnaire included a question about the participant's status, i.e. whether he/she experienced COVID-19 or another person he/she knows. This is crucial to be clarified in the methodology section.   The authors mention that over 42% of participants received the COVID-19 test. What about the others that reported they have been infected? Is there a question about how the participants realised/clarified that they had been infected by COVID-19? I.e. what about testing methods? The authors present it as one of the limitations of the study, in the discussion and they could elaborate a little more on this.   I think the authors could present the questionnaire and its questions in the appendix.   It would be useful if the authors presented some socio-economic data about Myanmar, in the discussion, and connect them with the capacity of the population to afford the private clinics and healthcare, but also the current status of public hospitals and healthcare in the country (number of doctors and medical beds per capita, for instance).   They could also highlight the importance of the use of online consultation. What it means for the country, how it can help populations excluded from healthcare or quarantined and whether it could be more applicable in the future healthcare pathways.  The COVID-19 third wave in Myanmar following the military coup  The current study added the value of the knowledge gap on the COVID-19 impact at the community level. The available research papers on the COVID-19 were mainly conducted at the hospital level and online people movement. This study particularly highlights the true burden of COVID-19 within the population.   Overall, this is a very good study, highlighting the disrupted health system and its impact on the health care sector response particularly at the pandemic situation of COVID-19. Below are the few comments and suggestions.  Abstract Background: The first sentence of the background already concluding the severity of impact which is the main objective of the study. Background can be re-structured as “COVID-19 has disrupted health system of many countries including those developed nations. The impact is particularly worse in those resource limited settings including Myanmar. First and second waves in Myanmar during 2020 were effectively managed by the government. However, the momentum was disrupted due to the military coup in early 2021.  People in Myanmar experienced serious consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated by the disorganized health system under the military junta. This study aimed to analyze the situation of COVID-19 occurrence and death proportions during its third wave in Myanmar.”  Conclusion: The conclusion of "" The data suggests that the outcomes were adversely impacted by the military coup."" is very strong, but the results of the study does not directly refer to this outcome. I would suggest to improve the conclusion as: ""The data suggests that COVID-19 third wave severely hit Myanmar, adverse outcome fueled by the military coup. However, the online Telehealth clinics operated by Ministry of Health (MoH), Myanmar National Unity Government (NUG), offered the alternative accessible solution for the certain population within the country.""  Introduction: Well written and structured.  Method: Given the descriptive nature of the study (exploratory), the current method and data analysis are enough for the study. However, given the large number of participants, regression analysis can be performed to see the factors associated with outcomes (recovered/death/complications).  It is worthy to investigate risk of death (or) complications in association with cumulative symptoms (having two or more symptoms versus having only one by applying multilevel poisson regression model.   Results: Table (1): For those with outcome of death, who fill in the information in the google form. It would be great if the authors shared the survey google form (English translated version).
